: 
:  Get the questions that users in {ids} have favorited.
: 
:  This method is effectively a view onto a user's favorites tab.
: 
:  {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids. To find ids programmatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
: 
:  The sorts accepted by this method operate on the following fields of the question object:
: 
:      activity – last_activity_date
:      creation – creation_date
:      votes – score
:      added – when the user favorited the question
: 
:  activity is the default sort.
: 
:  It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
: 
:  This method returns a list of questions.

: You're correct that the methods I described are a far cry from actually guaranteeing that the backup has no errors. In the same way that a unit test doesn't prove code is error-free, but _can_ justify increased confidence in the code, I'm interested in techniques that can justify increased confidence in my backups. Particularly in cases where I don't have direct access to the original data, and where exhaustively checking the data manually is too time-consuming to be worth it.

yes!

: Seriously, check out ratarmount if you haven't. Since the Google Takeout spans multiple 50GB tgz files (I'm at ~14, not including Google Drive in the takeout), ratarmount is brilliant. It merges all of the tgz contents into a single folder structure so /path/a/1.jpg and /path/a/1.json might be in different tgz folders but are mounted in to the same folder.
