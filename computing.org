Software must eat the world, there is just no other way.
How can we make it more powerful, intuitive, pleasant to use?

: A "Schlep" is a thing that is so tedious or awful to deal with, that most people accept it or work around it without even realizing it. However, when attacked directly, they can open new doors or make things easier by opening paths that are otherwise accepted as just "the way things are".

: Computing aids and encourages humanity’s noblest pursuits: science, reason, art, philosophy.
: Computing directly supports improving the mental health, physical health, prosperity, and happiness of all humans.
: Computing help us master (or at least, doesn’t intensify) our problematic tendencies: addiction, status anxiety, socioeconomic divisions, tribalism, fear, hate.
: The economic and intellectual horsepower in Silicon Valley and the wider tech world seems to be pointed away from these goals.
: For example: algorithms designed to maximize watch time, the social media outrage machine, loot boxes and other psuedo-gambling, and smartphone notifications activating Skinner-box tendencies.

: What's crazy to me is how insanely overspec'd mobile devices are for what they deliver. If you went back in time and told 1999 me the following:
: I'll give you a computer with the following:
: * 256GB of solid-state storage
: * 6 CPUs @ 3+GHz
: * 8GB of RAM
: * Weighs only 200 grams
: * Battery-powered, lasts 5+ hours
: * 1440 x 3168 resolution display
: I would have been absolutely gobsmacked. Such a machine absolutely outclasses every desktop up into the early 2010s!
: 
: And then you would tell me that it's mostly used to shitpost on reddit and Twitter and would be completely useless as a development machine, and the manufactures would do everything to make it impossible to put what software I want on it...and also it would spy on me everywhere I went in order to sell me garbage...
: We took a wrong turn somewhere, didn't we?
