Software must eat the world, there is just no other way.
How can we make it more powerful, intuitive, pleasant to use?

: Some things that work really well that are often hard in native GUI toolkits:
:     You can zoom pretty much any content as large or small as you like. Doing this in native UI involves either editing obscure config files, or mucking about with the system’s DPI settings (not easy to zoom per-app or changing zoom levels depending on mood or screen you’re using).
:     More cross-platform than pretty much anything else.
:     Open anything in a new context (tab or window).
:     Copy/paste anything.
:     Search any text with e.g. Ctrl+F.
:     Back button.
:     Modifying anything easily; even if you’re not doing this directly yourself this has huge benefits in the form of e.g. some simple bookmarklets, or your adblocker.
:     Unlike desktop applications, everything is sandboxed. If you think persistent tracking and fingerprinting on the web is bad: it’s even easier on the desktop. Something like hash(/etc/passwd) should do the trick to generate a persistent unique device ID.
:     Very compatible; the first website: last modified somewhere in the early 90s still works in your Firefox or Chrome today.

: The point is really that lenses are values that represent locations in a data structure. And, as values, they can be combined, transformed, serialized, etc etc. Imagine having a type that represents a chain of method selectors, and that gives you some idea of the purpose.
: The fact that method selectors only appear very rarely as first-class values in most languages means that most people aren’t tuned in to scenarios where they could be applied. But I bet you’ve invented special cases of this yourself, when you had a function that needed to dig data out of one of several locations, depending on other inputs.

really awesome talk! 
coolest thing in the second part, he talks of his desire to give creators better tools as part of his idenitity. basically, it hurts him when he sees creators struggling, when ideas can't be born. he sees injustice in that (similar to my trip experience!)
he mentions that to find some principle to invent on he just did many different things. Very inspirational!

: In my opinion, a security model that cuts this deeply into the ecosystem and customisability deserves only criticism. I don’t want to have such a platform for my personal computing needs.
: Security is nice, but my needs on my own machine come first. A device that is secure but doesn’t do what I want is useless to me. I need root access to make my machine do what I want because that is the only purpose the machine has: To do what I and only I want. I don’t need a machine that does what someone else wants - they should buy and maintain that machine if it serves them! The von Neumann architecture contains a memory that stores data and instructions.
: I don’t want to go back into computing stone age before von Neumann just because Apple (or anyone else, for that matter) thinks only they know what’s okay to execute.
