: Dirac's writing was famous for its clarity and simplicity. When Niels Bohr was writing a scientific paper - with many hesitations and redraftings, as was his custom, Bohr stopped: "I do not know how to finish this sentence."
: Dirac replied: "I was taught at school that you should never start a sentence without knowing the end

:  ~~Electronics~~ Electrons (thanks /u/StopDataAbuse) push each other away because of their negativity. This is what transfers the signal, and goes at about 50% to 99% of the speed of light depending on the material. Note that this is not related to the actual speed of the electrons themselves.
:  Now the speed of the electrons themselves is more interesting (I think). I once calculated this and I'll do it again for fun. Let's take a simple DC circuit:
:  3 volt power source, 3 ohm resistor giving 1A of current. Lets take 18 awg copper wires with a cross section surface of 0.823mm^2 according to [this](http://www.technick.net/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=guide_awg_to_metric). The length of the wires we'll define as L meter, as you'll see it doesn't matter which L we pick as long as we ignore the resistance it brings.
:  The volume of the wire is 0.823mm^2 * L meter = 0.823 10^-6 * L m^3. The density of the wire is (from Wikipedia) 8.96 g * cm^-3  = 8960 kg * m^-3. Multiply those numbers and we'll get the weight of the wire, which is 7.374 * L * 10^-3 kg. I searched for the number of free electrons every copper atom has, and a google search returns 1. So now we need the number of atoms in those wires. 7.347 * L g / (63.546 g / mol) * 6.022 * 10^23 / mol = 6.988 * 10^22 L. That's the number of free electrons in the wires. 1A is 1C / s = 6.241 * 10^18 electrons per second. That's the number of electrons that flow into the wire and out the other end every second. Divide 6.988 * 10^22 L with 6.241 * 10^18 / s and you'll get 11197 * L s. That's the number of seconds any electron stays in the wires before leaving the other end. Divide the length by this time and you'll get the speed: speed = L meters (as the length of the wires were L) / (11197Ls) = 8.93 × 10^-5 m / s. That's not very fast. It would take over 3 hours to travel through a 1 meter wire. Hope I got all the numbers right :S

Then I made it mandatory for a few files that I was the only active contributor to. Then I slowly added more and more files across the project, sometimes as I touched them for other reason and other times as independent changes. Eventually as mypy caught more and more bugs in other contributor's changes they started getting on board and adding type hints as well, until the vast majority of the project was hinted (we'll be getting to 100% within a few weeks).

: My approach is to dial up strictness gradually as code proves its value. I'll start out building a project and not validating on I/O, but as the requirements get locked down and the code has proven itself, I'll clean up all the edge cases - which will often mean adding in progressively stricter validation on border code.
: The advantage of this is that if you end up not wasting too much time "building the wrong thing". Let's say that you took one form of I/O and built massively strict validation in and then realized later that you should have taken an entirely different form of I/O for your subsystem. All that time building in validation on that useless part of code was a pointless waste.
: I don't have any stats, but my gut feel is that on average 40% of code can end up being tossed in this way (in some projects it's 100% =).
: Prototyping speed is, additionally, not just useful in reducing the cost of building the right kind of code, it's useful in reducing the cost of building the right kind of test (a really underappreciated facet of building mission critical systems).

In my younger years I used to believe that for mission critical systems "building the wrong thing" was somehow less of a problem in code because you could fix requirements and do architecture upfront with some sort of genius architect. Turns out this was wrong.

There's actually a very cool effect where either getting infected with flu or getting vaccinated boosts your antibody response to all previous strains of flu you've encountered (by getting flu or by being vaccinated). In recent years WHO have begun to shift towards using antigenically advanced vaccines, whereby they predict how currently circulating strains of flu will evolve and artificially create vaccines for the flu strain they think will be circulating in 6 months time, as even if the virus doesn't mutate to a new strain, the antibody backboost means you still get protection against most circulating strains. Check out this paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246172/) if you want a more detailed explanation, but basically the vaccine can boost your antibody response to a fairly wide range of influenza virus strains  (this is at least true for type A H3N2 influenza, there are 4 different types of influenza in the annual vaccine)

During World War II, the German atomic energy program decided, by 1942, to be entirely focused on reactor development. This was, they thought, the area of nuclear fission research was most likely to produce useful military results in the short term. They thought bombs were probably possible but incredibly difficult to construct, and did not think any other nation was going to have any success with them in the short term. The German teams honestly thought they were ahead of the entire world in fission research, and when a group of the top people were carted off to a British manor house, Farm Hall, at the end of the war, they thought that maybe the Allies were trying to keep them from giving their knowledge to the Soviets (true) and that the Allies would want their knowledge for themselves (false).

When they heard about the bombing of Hiroshima, they were shocked and surprised. Many of them refused to believe the United States could have pulled off a bomb. After getting more news information and talking it over, they realized it was in fact possible if the USA had thrown tremendous resources at it, and also realized that some of their assumptions about the size of the critical mass for the bomb were off.

This left them in a tricky situation in terms of their egos and their nationalism. Were they simply failures? This is what Otto Hahn (discoverer of fission, and no fan of Hitler) suggested — that they were just second-raters.

But many of them started to create and cling to a different story. They weren't accidental failures — maybe they were _deliberate_ failures. Maybe they didn't really _want_ to make a bomb, and that's why they didn't do it. This isn't the same thing as saying they _intentionally sabotaged_ the project, but it was more of a psychological explanation. If they had wanted to make a bomb, surely they would have done more work in that direction, right? So they must not have wanted to make a bomb. Because who would want to give Hitler a bomb?

This story — known to historians as the _Lesart_ of the German atomic program — was propagated in subtle ways in the aftermath of World War II. It achieved its initial circulation in Robert Jungk's _ Brighter than a Thousand Suns_ (_Heller als tausend Sonnen_) in 1956. Jungk was the first to suggest, based on a vague _Lesart_ explanation offered up by Heisenberg, that Heisenberg had intentionally sabotaged the project. Heisenberg himself was somewhat appalled by this. Here is what he wrote to Jungk in 1956:

> You speak here towards the end of the second paragraph about active resistance to Hitler, and I believe—pardon my frankness—that this passage is determined by a total misunderstanding of a totalitarian dictatorship. In a dictatorship active resistance can only be practiced by people who seemingly take part in the system. When someone speaks openly against the system, he quite certainly deprives himself of any possibility of active resistance. For either he then expresses his criticism of the system only occasionally in a politically harmless form, and then his political influence can be blocked very easily; say, with respect to the youth, by people saying: Sure, old Professor X is a nice old man, but he naturally has no understanding for the enthusiasm of the youth, or something of the sort. Or, conversely, he really tries, say, to move the students politically, and then within a few days he naturally would meet his end in a concentration camp, and even his self-sacrificing death would remain practically unknown, since no one would be allowed to talk about it. _I would not want this remark to be misunderstood as saying that I myself engaged in resistance to Hitler._

Which is rather equivocating to say the least. Heisenberg isn't actually implying he did _anything_ in this particular letter, though he is implying that he did some kind of passive resistance.

Historians have gone over Heisenberg's wartime activities in detail. There's no evidence whatsoever of intentional sabotage. Heisenberg actually went to great lengths to show he was in line with Nazi Germany's overall foreign intentions, and used his position to stump for Germany and German culture in occupied countries. He vigorously pursued reactor research. He did not vigorously pursue bomb research, but this is because, again, he did not think it was feasible in the short term. Here is another Heisenberg letter to Jungk, from 1957:

> [In 1941] we in the uranium project had come to the following conclusion, on the basis of our experiments with uranium and heavy water: It will definitely be possible to build an energy-producing reactor out of uranium and heavy water. In this reactor (on the basis of theoretical work by von Weizsäcker) a product of U-239 [U-239 decays into Plutonium-239] will be generated that, like U-235, will be suitable as an explosive for atomic bombs. At the time we did not know of any process that could have produced significant quantities of U-235 with an effort that could be realized technically in Germany under wartime conditions. Since the production of atomic explosives using reactors could also obviously be realized only through many years of running huge reactors, it was clear to us in any case that the production of atomic bombs would only be possible with an enormous technical effort. Thus we knew that atomic bombs could be made in principle, but we also estimated that the necessary technical effort was
bigger than it really was.

> This situation seemed to us a particularly favorable precondition for the physicists to have an influence on the further course of events. For if the production of atomic bombs had been impossible, then the problem would not have arisen at all; but if it had been easily possible, then the physicists surely would not have been able to hinder their production. But the actual situation gave the physicists at this time a decisive influence on the further course of events, since they could argue vis-a-vis their governments that the atomic bombs would probably not come into
play in the course of the war, or else argue that it would instead perhaps still be possible, with absolutely enormous efforts, to put them into play. That both ways of arguing were objectively fully justified was shown by the course of developments; for in fact even the Americans could not put the atomic bomb to use against Germany.

The first paragraph of this letter is born out through documentation — the Germans knew that reactors might be a route to the bomb, but they also knew it would require large reactors. Their work on a small research reactor (which would have been worthless for bomb use) was slow and piecemeal and did not reflect any active bomb concern. They knew about uranium enrichment but considered it too difficult to really pursue in earnest.

The second paragraph is the more problematic one. Again, Heisenberg isn't actually saying that he sabotaged anything. What he's saying was, under the conditions that existed, physicists could have pushed for the bomb if they really thought they could do it, but nobody in the government would fault them if they didn't. Is he saying they didn't push for the bomb because they didn't want Hitler to have one? No. But he's allowing that interpretation to be made if you want to make it.

In short, even Heisenberg himself didn't ever really claim that he sabotaged the German atomic bomb project in any real way. At best he implied that maybe he wasn't as enthusiastic about the bomb as he could have been, which is in line with the preservation of the idea that he wasn't just a screw-up on this front. But there's no evidence he did anything like that. Of course, as Heisenberg himself pointed out in the first letter I quoted, the nature of being a passive resister in a totalitarian government is that you appear to be going along with the plan but you might not actually be going along with it. This makes the Heisenberg issue a tricky one for historians, because, as he points out, if he simply withheld enthusiasm for the bomb but otherwise made like a good German, it would be _indistinguishable_ from the situation where he just didn't push for it because he thought it wasn't very feasible.

I think the Farm Hall transcripts make it clear that Heisenberg truly didn't think it was feasible, and in fact hadn't thought seriously about the physics of atomic bombs at all. (His discussions there reflect deep misunderstandings about how fast neutron fission chain reactions work.) Which to me puts him in the "was just a screw-up" camp, as opposed to the "was silently and passively resisting" camp.

It all really depends on your definition of a rocky planet. Or a rock for that matter.

[Athleticon93](/u/Athleticon93) is right for normally formed planets. Any planet getting really big as just a rocky planet is going to accrete lots of gas too and become a gas giant. But if we want to *make* a really big rocky planet, physics won't stop us for a while

Start with a chunk of rock floating around in space. Let's say we borrowed mars for a bit. Don't worry, the solar system won't ask for it back. Now toss a rock down onto it. You have a bigger rocky planet. Keep doing that for a bit. The planet gets bigger and bigger. Surface gravity increases, and for now, the density of material at the core stays the same (ish). Things start to fork at this point though, depending on the thought experiment.

First off, just dropping the rocks is going to be a problem. Dumping planetfulls of rocks onto an ever larger planet makes heat. A *lot* of heat, which will liquefy, and eventually boil our rocks. This will also drive out any volatiles in the rock; gasses, bound water, sulfur, etc. Pretty much anything that isn't iron or nickel or another high boiling element or very stable compound. For example, limestone, a common rock, will happily decompose to CO2 and CaO. Now our ball of rocks is surrounded by an ever thickening atmosphere of gasses. Whoops, we made a gas giant.

So lets start again, but instead we'll teleport our rocks down to the surface. Compaction will produce some heat, but not enough to boil our rocks. *Yet...*

The planet could get quite big (somewhere around 3-4 times the radius of the earth), but eventually the compressive forces of gravity will be enough to start severely compressing even solid material. The density of the core will go way up. You'll notice you're adding hundreds of cubic kilometres of stuff and your planet is only growing by tens of cubic kilometers. This is going to make a lot of heat. If our rocks have a fair bit of lighter elements in them (pretty much anything higher on the periodic table than iron), eventually somewhere around 60 times the mass of Jupiter the heat and pressure will be too much and our "rocky planet" will ignite into a very weird star

Let's start again, again. We can't use rocks anymore, but we can use iron. Iron is at least a solid, and we can imagine running around on it pretty similarly to a regular planet. Get a big ball of iron and start the teleportation machine again with chunks of iron instead of rocks. Again, you'll see the planet grow, but after a certain point, roughly 2.5 times the radius of the earth, and several hundred times the mass, adding more mass will actually cause the radius to shrink. The iron planet will also be getting very very hot (tens of thousands of kelvin). What's happening is that the additional matter is causing increased gravity, and your planet is no longer being supported by the everyday pressure of electrostatics, like what keeps your feet from compressing a concrete floor. Instead the core is now dominated by electron degeneracy pressure. It's acting like a very hot, ultra dense gas. As you add more iron, you create more gravity. More gravity makes more pressure, more degenerate matter, and a smaller radius. Your "planet" is now a white dwarf. If you let it cool off for a few trillion years you'd be left with a ball of iron that, if you could walk around in about a hundred thousand g's of gravity, you could walk on and would be (sorta, kinda) like a planet. And that's as big as you can make a planet.

: Some things that work really well that are often hard in native GUI toolkits:
:     You can zoom pretty much any content as large or small as you like. Doing this in native UI involves either editing obscure config files, or mucking about with the system’s DPI settings (not easy to zoom per-app or changing zoom levels depending on mood or screen you’re using).
:     More cross-platform than pretty much anything else.
:     Open anything in a new context (tab or window).
:     Copy/paste anything.
:     Search any text with e.g. Ctrl+F.
:     Back button.
:     Modifying anything easily; even if you’re not doing this directly yourself this has huge benefits in the form of e.g. some simple bookmarklets, or your adblocker.
:     Unlike desktop applications, everything is sandboxed. If you think persistent tracking and fingerprinting on the web is bad: it’s even easier on the desktop. Something like hash(/etc/passwd) should do the trick to generate a persistent unique device ID.
:     Very compatible; the first website: last modified somewhere in the early 90s still works in your Firefox or Chrome today.

: When you consider that von Neumann was Jewish, and had worked in Germany just before Hitler's rise to power, and certainly had many, many friends and colleagues lose their lives in the death camps--it starts to make a bit of sense. With historical figures like this, I often find it helpful to imagine being in their shoes making decisions, rather than thinking about it from our detached current-day perspective with perfect hindsight.
: Also you've probably learned that von Neumann invented the modern subject of game theory. He understood that Mutual Assured Destruction meant that, ironically, the great powers would be unlikely to ever use nuclear weapons against each other. Which has--so far--been the case. Von Neumann, if he were alive today, might point out that the number of people killed in wars has dramatically dropped since the invention of the bomb.

These molecules are rather large. How are molecular structures determined so exactly? When did chemists acquire this capability? And what were the major milestones in our ability to determine molecular structure?


: I don't just mean how many of each kind of element and where they are, but also things as subtle as the position of a single double bond. A lot of molecules are smaller than a wavelength of visible light, so it's not as if we could just look at them under a microscope, yet we know their structures exactly. So how do chemists figure these things out?

In general, the radiation sensitivity of a tissue is:

proportional to the rate of proliferation of its cells
inversely proportional to the degree of cell differentiation
For example, the following tissues and organs are listed from most radiosensitive to least radiosensitive: 

Most Sensitive: Blood-forming organs
Reproductive organs
Skin
Bone and teeth
Muscle
Least sensitive: Nervous system

This also means that a developing embryo is most sensitive to radiation during the early stages of differentiation, and an embryo/fetus is more sensitive to radiation exposure in the first trimester than in later trimesters

: Chris Granger (creator of Eve) presents and interesting point about creating multiple tools instead of one general purpose one: http://www.chris-granger.com/2015/01/26/coding-is-not-the-new-literacy/#fn2
: The take-away for me is to build different tools for different needs, but have a way to easily transport models from one to the other. For example, using something like Bret Victor's dynamic drawing medium for rendering, and then "dragging" the data (or code) into something better suited for editing program flow.

: Wikipedia is even pushing further forward on that vision with Wikidata, a general-purpose knowledge base that's perhaps the most successful example of such a thing, succeeding where many other efforts have failed dismally. (Already, Wikidata gets more edits per minute than Wikipedia, albeit much of the activity is performed by bots.) It's also a successful use of Linked-Open-Data and Semantic-Web technologies (the Wikidata site hosts a SPARQL endpoint, for general queries of all sorts), so while it might not be "Old Web" per se, it feels quite retro-futuristic in many ways.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27907373/dynamically-change-slots-in-python-3
: Normally, an object's attributes are stored in a dict, which requires a fair bit of memory itself. If you are creating millions of objects then the space required by these dicts becomes prohibitive. __slots__ informs the python machinery that makes the class object that there will only be so many attributes refered to by instances of this class and what the names of the attributes will be. Therefore, the class can make an optimisation by storing the attributes directly on the instance rather than in a dict. It places the memory for the (pointers to the) attributes directly on the object, rather than creating a new dict for the object.
