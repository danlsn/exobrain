- this works... but doesn't if setup.py is guarded with __main__
  : import distutils.core as C; C.run_setup("setup.py", stop_after='config')

  could check for __name__ == 'builtins'... but then would need to modify all files, and might not reliably work
- can't just copy setup.py outside, because it might need .git directory for scm_version thing
  fuuck.
- adding to easy_install.pth works.. but need to figure out what's the base pkg directory...
- ok, added a hacky script to infra repo

: For a better PDF experience, you might want to try 'koreader'. The native PDF support on my Kobo Forma was so bad I was ready to return it, before finding this. It's an open source PDF/epub reader that you can install on Remarkable and other eInk readers. It's just an app - it doesn't replace or degrade any existing functionality.

: Simplified git version control only limited by your storage space.
: Synchronization algorithm that can handle moved files and empty directories and files.
: Your data does not need to be stored on the device you are currently using.
: FUSE filesystem that feels like a normal sync folder.
: No central server at all. Still, central architectures can be build with brig.
: Gateway and Web based UI to share normal HTTP/S links with other users.
: Auto-updating facility that will sync on any change.
