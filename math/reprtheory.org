*** [#B] [2019-02-07] Spinors, on the other hand, are constructed in such a way that makes them sensitive to how the gradual rotation of the coordinates arrived there: they exhibit path-dependence. It turns out that, for any final configuration of the coordinates, there are actually two ("topologically") inequivalent gradual (continuous) rotations of the coordinate system that result in this same configuration. This ambiguity is called the homotopy class of the gradual rotation

Selection:
In quantum physics and quantum chemistry, each set of degenerate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator comprises a vector space V for a representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, a "multiplet", best studied through reduction to its irreducible parts. Identifying the irreducible representations therefore allows one to label the states, predict how they will split under perturbations; or transition to other states in V. Thus, in quantum mechanics, irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the system partially or completely label the energy levels of the system, allowing the selection rules to be determined.[5]

** [#B] [2019-01-10]  Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge q at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy E1=qV1 and destroying it released E2=qV2, which would seem natural since qV measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, qV2-qV1, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, qV2-qV1. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation {\displaystyle V\rightarrow V+C} V\rightarrow V+C, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules E1=qV1 and E2=qV2 for the energies of creation and destruction would allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge q at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is {\displaystyle V} V and {\displaystyle V+C} V+C respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.[1

Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a fixed amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a varying amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's "clock" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(x), where x measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinde  

In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, general relativity states that gravitational fields have energy, and special relativity concludes that energy is equivalent to mass.

The generators of the group are the partial derivatives of the group elements with respect to the group parameters with the result evaluated when the parameter is set to zero:

X j = ∂ g ∂ ξ j | ξ j = 0 {\displaystyle X_{j}=\left.{\frac {\partial g}{\partial \xi _{j}}}\right|_{\xi _{j}=0}} X_{j}=\left.{\frac {\partial g}{\partial \xi _{j}}}\right|_{\xi _{j}=0}

In the language of manifolds, the generators are the elements of the tangent space to G at the identity. The generators are also known as infinitesimal group elements or as the elements of the Lie algebra of G. (See the discussion below of the commutator.)

ok, -a is kinda obvious? reverse path is still a path


than means that for all delta exists {a_1 ... a_N}, s.t. a_1 x ... x a_n = a
ams for b. than, for a + b just take N = N_a + N_b and 


ahh ok. path is a function from [0, 1] to space, s.t. p(0) = start, p(1) = end
right, so p_a(0) = 0, p_a(1) = a; p_b(0) = 0, p_b(1) = b; 
then p_(a+b)(t) = p_a(t)  + p_b(t). p(0) = 0; p(a + b) = a + b; the mapping is continuous since group operation is smooth

there is a path in G_0 , so for t from 0 to 1 : g p(t) inv(g) --- ???     
not sure if that leads us somewhere...

ok, looked up the answer. it's pretty trivial; connected space is connected under a cont. map; since conjugation is continuous, it maps onto a connected space. since it maps identity into identity, that connected space is G_0.
eh, I'm an idiot. actually, my path approach does solve it, just literally notice that p_b(t) = g p_a(t) inv(g) is a continuous map connecting 0 with some point.

WHERE X IS NOT NECESSARILY IN A!
so , take X = Y = {1, 2, 3}. f = id; X topoplogy is trivial; Y is discrete.
then take p = 1 and A = {2, 3}.
p is in closure of A, so touches it.

:END:
in trivial topology, all points seem close; however when mapped to discrete, they fall apart
in the same sense, the function is not continuous if two points that seemed indistinguishable end up in topoplogically distinguishable sets
e.g. step function that is 0 if x <= 0 and 1 if x > 0:
0 is not distinguishable from eps > 0. However it gets distinguished by the image space topology.
so, take the open set in Y: S_Y = {0}. its preimage S_x is (-inf, 0]. it's not open. what's the proplem with that?
take any larger open set T, containing S_y. its image is Y = {0,1}. or maybe even a sequence of open sets? they all get mapped to Y. But there will be a sudden jump to just {0} in the limit

in terms of closure, it's a bit easier. 0 is close to (0, inf). however f(0), which is 0 is not close to closure({1}), which is {1}.


*** I thhink I got an intuition for quotient space topology. basically: we map X to X/~. So, to derive topoplogy for quotient space, let's just assume ~ is continuous. then we'd naturally want open subsets in quotient space to be the ones with open preimage

for x ~ y == x - y is integer:
interesting case I suppose is when a set S contains 0. then, we split it in two parts: 'left' to 0 and 'right or zero' (well defined, otherwise it's all space)
the only interesting case if (-a, b)? Otherwise can't be open since contains limit points.
preimage of (-a, 0): infinite union of Union_k (k-a, k)
preimage of [0, b): infinite union Union_k [k, k + b)
regrouping, we get infinite union Unkion_k (k - a, k + b); which is an open set.
ok, boring, we get the original topology

suppose T_Q (topology) is not discrete. that means there is A_Q in Q such that {A_Q} is not open. A_Q corresponds to G^0 + [some] A, so that means it is not open in the original topology T. however, that contradicts G^0 + A being connected component.

Every component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets (singletons), which are not open.

ok. so manifolds are locally path connected and connected components of locally connected space are also open.

C is a covering space if there is a surjective map p: C -> X, such that for every x in X there is U(x), s.t. p^-1(U) is a union of disjoint open sets in C, each of them is mapped homeomorphically onto U.

the definition probably only seems fiddly if you haven't seen it (or related) definitions before. What is says is the following: a map p:Y→X is a covering map if p locally looks like the projection from
X× a discrete space→X.
A little more precisely: each point x∈X has a neighbourhood U such that the map
p−1(U)→U
is isomorphic to a projection
U× a discrete space→U.

I haven't read the mechanics book you mentioned, so I don't know how similar these are to that, but some good books I've used that go into representation theory outside of particle physics are Hamermesh's Group theory and its application to physical problems and Petrashen's Applications of group theory in quantum mechanics.

I am a math student and I like seeing the narrative of math applied to physics. I am reading through Georgi's "Lie Algebras in Particle Physics" now, and chapters 1.16 and 1.17 use representation theory to easily characterize the normal modes of a quirky system of springs and blocks.

I once read through the book "Solved Problems in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics" by Gignoux & Silvestre-Brac, and it helped me see the non-pure side of the symplectic dynamics/variational calculus I was learning. I really liked this applied section in Georgi. I never saw these techniques in undergrad physics and I find it really cool. Do you know of any other sources that go through specific examples/calculation problems in physics and apply representation theory?
