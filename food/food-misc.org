 butter milk: sourness???

- fluffiness
- lactic acid

  lactic acid + baking soda
  don't let batter seat, bubbles with escape
  browning: baking soda maillard reaction, basic environment
  overmixing batter makes it tough. too much gluten is formed, makes them chewy. Fat slows down gluten

* [2018-05-29] Oil: one reason for using oil is just to make a thermal path between the pan and the food, so the food doesn't only cook exactly where it touches.

:END:
: The reason boiling doesn't achieve browning, is that water cannot be heated above 100C, except at extreme pressures. The Maillard Reaction is commonly what turns food brown and produces a pleasant taste, and this happens at 140 to 160 C.
: And according to: http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-frying
: "When food is plunged into hot oil, the water in the food starts to boil and percolate toward the surface. In order for a crisp, dry crust to develop, there must be a barrier between the hot oil and the migrating water. This barrier is typically something starchy. As the starch fries in the hot oil, it dries into a pleasantly crisp shell and protects the moisture beneath. The food inside steams while the coating browns and crisps."
: EDIT: As /u/Choralone points out below, the Maillard reaction can take place at lower temperatures, but very slowly. So cooking items over several hours can sometimes produce similar results, but perhaps not with the types of food that are normally fried.

1. freeze
2. lower pressure
3. reach the pressure where water goes directly from ice to vapour
4. fruits remain undamaged by the temperature

* [#D] Debunk This: This is The Most Powerful Natural Antibiotic Ever â€“ Kills Any Infections in The Body https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkThis/comments/2sfk0g/debunk_this_this_is_the_most_powerful_natural/

: Garlic:
: It does contain an antibiotic compound known as allicin. The wiki article does a good job summing it up: allicin comes from bruised garlic tissue (but not from consumed garlic in the body). You can see the inhibitory concentrations in the article run as low at 16 mg/L in water. To reach those levels in the human body, you'd need roughly 5.5 times as much: ~88 mg in your circulating blood. Since there's roughly 9 mg allicin per garlic clove, this recipe would need roughly 10 cloves of garlic per dose. However, this same study did find an interesting use for purified allicin at level far above what you find in garlic.

: Hot peppers
: Without an exact species of pepper, we can just assume the ingredient of interest here is the spice itself: capsaicin. Medical uses of capsaicin are primarily in pain treatment, not in fighting infections. I have found no evidence that consuming capsaicin is antibiotic.
* TODO oven camembert (250g?) + 200-300g steamed tenderstem broccoli/asparagus spears (very ergonipic for dipping in cheese) :recipe:

- cut camembert on top and put in oven for 20 minutes (about 200 degrees)
- [optional] top with some conserve or berries or pomegranate seeds
- put for 5 more minutes
- also nice with gherkins
