 butter milk: sourness???

- fluffiness
- lactic acid

  lactic acid + baking soda
  don't let batter seat, bubbles with escape
  browning: baking soda maillard reaction, basic environment
  overmixing batter makes it tough. too much gluten is formed, makes them chewy. Fat slows down gluten

* [2018-05-29] Oil: one reason for using oil is just to make a thermal path between the pan and the food, so the food doesn't only cook exactly where it touches.
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
: The reason boiling doesn't achieve browning, is that water cannot be heated above 100C, except at extreme pressures. The Maillard Reaction is commonly what turns food brown and produces a pleasant taste, and this happens at 140 to 160 C.
: And according to: http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-frying
: "When food is plunged into hot oil, the water in the food starts to boil and percolate toward the surface. In order for a crisp, dry crust to develop, there must be a barrier between the hot oil and the migrating water. This barrier is typically something starchy. As the starch fries in the hot oil, it dries into a pleasantly crisp shell and protects the moisture beneath. The food inside steams while the coating browns and crisps."
: EDIT: As /u/Choralone points out below, the Maillard reaction can take place at lower temperatures, but very slowly. So cooking items over several hours can sometimes produce similar results, but perhaps not with the types of food that are normally fried.

* [#D] Debunk This: This is The Most Powerful Natural Antibiotic Ever – Kills Any Infections in The Body https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkThis/comments/2sfk0g/debunk_this_this_is_the_most_powerful_natural/

: Garlic:
: It does contain an antibiotic compound known as allicin. The wiki article does a good job summing it up: allicin comes from bruised garlic tissue (but not from consumed garlic in the body). You can see the inhibitory concentrations in the article run as low at 16 mg/L in water. To reach those levels in the human body, you'd need roughly 5.5 times as much: ~88 mg in your circulating blood. Since there's roughly 9 mg allicin per garlic clove, this recipe would need roughly 10 cloves of garlic per dose. However, this same study did find an interesting use for purified allicin at level far above what you find in garlic.
: 
: Hot peppers
: Without an exact species of pepper, we can just assume the ingredient of interest here is the spice itself: capsaicin. Medical uses of capsaicin are primarily in pain treatment, not in fighting infections. I have found no evidence that consuming capsaicin is antibiotic.

* [#C] [2018-05-03] Maillard reaction                  :gastronomy:chemistry:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       mllrdrctn
:END:
between amino acids and reducing (TODO?) sugar

about 220 degrees (TODO fahrenheit?) is necessary to trigger it

some Maillard reaction results enhance other flavors

Example:

Melting of sugar
TODO onions?? browning and umami taste


TODO exothermal, so easy to overcook

Temperatures need to be high to bring about the Maillard reaction, but as long as the food is very wet, its temperature won’t climb above the boiling point of water. At atmospheric pressure, only high-heat cooking techniques can dry out the food enough to raise the temperature sufficiently. It’s not the water that stops the reaction, but rather the low boiling point at normal, sea-level pressure. In the sealed environment of a pressure cooker, the Maillard reaction can, and does, occur.

Drying and browning the surface first will, however, allow the reaction to proceed slowly at temperatures below the boiling point of water.

: А это не вредно? Насколько я знаю, нет. Есть институты парентерального и энтерального питания (внутривенного и через трубочку, для людей в коме или с травмами, при которых по-другому питаться не получается). Такие кейсы не редки и люди десятилетиями так питаются, без наблюдаемого вреда для здоровья. Для них есть питание и смеси, одобренные FDA. Тем не менее, сложно сказать на 100%, т.к. нет лонгитюдных исследований.

: Очень люблю лондонские рынки — на тот же Боро-маркет по выходным хожу за своим любимым шоколадом в место под названием Rabot 1745. Еще люблю Mercato Metropolitano — итальянский рынок в районе Elephant and Castle, достаточно новый и пока не такой раскрученный. Там много хорошей еды, веселые люди, приятная музыка, а еще там есть узбекский ларек, где приятный хозяин (кстати, русскоговорящий) продает отличные манты и лагман.

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       snblnchngbrccl
:END:
: you can blanch broccoli to give it a more vibrant green color so it can look better on your plate.
: http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/freeze/blanching.html
: Blanching destroys the enzymes that turn food brown and destroy nutrients. These enzymes are not stooped at freezer temps, but slowed. If you're going to eat the food in a month or 3, blanching may not be necessary, but blanching will improve the flavor and texture of what comes out of the freezer later. http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/news/2012/blanching-vegetables-is-a-must-before-freezing
: 
: blanch with open lid; otherwise volatile acids are not carried away with steam and oxidise the vegetables
