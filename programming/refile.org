:PROPERTIES:

: Inversion of Control principle, which basically states that the flow of your application depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution, and such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions.
: This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator.

:END:
: Ionic is basically Cordova with Angular on top with a convenient CLI. In my experience Cordova apps tend to be laggy in the long run and the debugging process is relatively annoying when trying to debug native plugins (you have to build the app via xcode etc.). You should be aware that Cordova uses the web view to display the app. So it‚Äôs kinda like running a web page on your phone and trying to convince the user it‚Äôs a native app.
: React native on the other hand uses the native components of the OS. So it‚Äôs not a web view, which means your app will feel much smoother. The downside of react native is that it uses its own components on top of the native ones which makes it hard to reuse your frontend code to the extent you  could with a Cordova app.
: Personal opinion: In my opinion and based on my past experience I would go with react native if I had to choose a framework based on JavaScript.
: Hope this helps :)

: Vultr - Dirt Cheap VPS Hosting
: Since hobby projects rarely see high-volumes of traffic, the main concern is often cost rather than performance.
: 
: Vultr is my go-to solution for cheap hosting. As of this writing, the cheapest plan they offer is $2.50 a month. Although their cheapest plan defintely won‚Äôt be able to fuel your next high-powered computing project, it is a great solution when you need to host small scale tasks such as cron jobs.

: One variant of this is to use Python syntax but parse it with the `ast` module rather than evaluating it.
: This avoids the security problems and the risk that someone will start to write programs inside the configuration file, but gives you the reasonably nice and powerful syntax.
