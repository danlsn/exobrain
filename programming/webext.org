: AMO supports signing self-hosted (unlisted) versions, which we believe is a good replacement. With self-hosted versions, developers can create multiple development update channels if needed. They can easily move users between channels. The main caveat is that the files and update mechanisms need to be hosted by the developer

: Thanks for the advice! I was actually inspired to go down this route by seeing the things you‚Äôve been building. I think my interests are similar, but not quite the same.
: There are two main extensions I want to build. First, a way to archive and mark up webpages. There is a Chrome extension called Weava that does something similar, but it‚Äôs SaaS and I doesn‚Äôt seem to have a convenient export format.
: Second, I would like better history tools. In particular, often have the problem that I read an article or page and want to link to it in a blog post (or similar), but I‚Äôve forgotten how I found it. I‚Äôd like an extension that can maintain ‚Äúchains‚Äù of followed links so that I can always look up how I found something.
: I‚Äôm happy to get in touch and consider collaborating if you‚Äôre interested.

apparently doesn't work through webext regardless. once it's autosigned, you're screwed??
so to publish on AMO you always have to upload the zip

- with_secrets ./build --firefox --release --lint
  dump the zip extension
- choose to upload it AS LISTED on AMO
- git archive master --output=promnesia-source.zip -- upload source

huh. interesting, it seemed to have published instantly...
