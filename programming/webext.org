apparently doesn't work through webext regardless. once it's autosigned, you're screwed??
so to publish on AMO you always have to upload the zip

- with_secrets ./build --firefox --release --lint
  dump the zip extension
- choose to upload it AS LISTED on AMO
- git archive master --output=promnesia-source.zip -- upload source

huh. interesting, it seemed to have published instantly...
- [2020-05-19] and again, published immediately... odd!

: Thanks for the advice! I was actually inspired to go down this route by seeing the things you‚Äôve been building. I think my interests are similar, but not quite the same.
: There are two main extensions I want to build. First, a way to archive and mark up webpages. There is a Chrome extension called Weava that does something similar, but it‚Äôs SaaS and I doesn‚Äôt seem to have a convenient export format.
: Second, I would like better history tools. In particular, often have the problem that I read an article or page and want to link to it in a blog post (or similar), but I‚Äôve forgotten how I found it. I‚Äôd like an extension that can maintain ‚Äúchains‚Äù of followed links so that I can always look up how I found something.
