: The question: what are the conditions for the function A -> B to be a subtype of C -> D?
: 
: 1. A is subtype of B means there is a special function castAB :: A -> B
: 2. Two casts compose into another casts, cast compositions are isomorphic (that is, castBC . castAB is essentially the same thing as castAC)
: 3. We wanna implement castAfB -> castCfD in order to show (A -> B) <: (C -> D)
: 
:   - X :: (A -> B) -> (C -> D)
:   - we can only use functions applications and cast
:   - X (fab :: A -> B) (c :: C) = ? :: D
:   - the only thing we can do is to transform c to some another type, that is, we need castCT :: C -> T
:   - now, we have (castCT c) :: T, basically, leaves us in the same situation, so, we actually need castCA :: C -> A
:   - now, we have (castCA c) :: A, and (fab $ castCA c) :: B. The only way to get D is to use castBD :: B -> D
: 
: 5. So, we have (A -> B) <: (C -> D), that is, A -> B is subtype of C -> D if C is subtype of A and B is subtype of D.
: 
: 
: The return type (B and D) is covariant, since preserves the direction of <:
: The argument type (A and C) is contravariant, since it flips the direction of <:
