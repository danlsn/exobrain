: The question: what are the conditions for the function A -> B to be a subtype of C -> D?
: 
: 1. A is subtype of B means there is a special function castAB :: A -> B
: 2. Two casts compose into another casts, cast compositions are isomorphic (that is, castBC . castAB is essentially the same thing as castAC)
: 3. We wanna implement castAfB -> castCfD in order to show (A -> B) <: (C -> D)
: 
:   - X :: (A -> B) -> (C -> D)
:   - we can only use functions applications and cast
:   - X (fab :: A -> B) (c :: C) = ? :: D
:   - the only thing we can do is to transform c to some another type, that is, we need castCT :: C -> T
:   - now, we have (castCT c) :: T, basically, leaves us in the same situation, so, we actually need castCA :: C -> A
:   - now, we have (castCA c) :: A, and (fab $ castCA c) :: B. The only way to get D is to use castBD :: B -> D
: 
: 5. So, we have (A -> B) <: (C -> D), that is, A -> B is subtype of C -> D if C is subtype of A and B is subtype of D.
: 
: 
: The return type (B and D) is covariant, since preserves the direction of <:
: The argument type (A and C) is contravariant, since it flips the direction of <:
: 
: 
: Container reading: covariant:

: Most of this advice is stuff they tell you in school that doesn‚Äôt matter at all in reality.
: Real advice:
: - Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works. (I.e. prefer normal forms but denormal will have better performance.)
: - You need nullable dates and nullable numbers. You never need a nullable string. If you must distinguish blank string from unset, add a column called ‚Äúunset‚Äù. Using null for this will just result in bad data entry.
: - Names should be stored as display_name, first_name, and last_name. A display name is not the same as just first plus last. They have different purposes, so don‚Äôt shove them together.
: - When in doubt, just have a column full of JSON and figure it out later.
: - Offset pagination is bad for performance. Avoid it at all costs unless you want some spider indexing page 10,432 of your archives to eat all your CPU.

: > `DOLIST` is similar to Perl's `foreach` or Python's `for`. Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the "enhanced" `for` loop in Java 1.5, as part of JSR-201. Notice what a difference macros make. A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source-level abstraction of that pattern. A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language. Then Sun has to publish a JSR and convene an industry-wide "expert group" to hash everything out. That process--according to Sun--takes an average of 18 months. After that, the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature. And even once the Java programmer's favorite compiler supports the new version of Java, they probably still can't use the new feature until they're allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java. So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years.
