: I found this answer to my troubles and it worked when I implemented it. Just change .babelrc to the following:
: {
:   "presets": [
:     [
:       "@babel/preset-env",

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42183155/is-it-safe-to-use-async-await-now
: So depending on what you think is acceptable it is either safe or not safe. Note the following:
:     This question was originally asked on 2017, and we have come a long way so async/await is much more safe to use now.
:     By 2019, most mobile devices already support async/await.
:     Node 8 is released on May 2017 so it should be safe to use async/await on Node.js unless your Node.js servers are very outdated.

https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/7z87o9/implementing_infinite_scrolling/
: ssuming its only 100 items, i'd just display them all from the start, and let scroll do what scroll does. if you're trying to simplify a real world example where you might have 1000's of initially returned items, then something similar to /u/pqnst but instead of just slicing 0,(page * 20), you'd have to slice(20 * (page - 1), 20 * page) and account for the height of the sliced out elements in the scrollTop of the scrolling container
