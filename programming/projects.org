Selection:
Peek does not support this natively. But you could install an external tool like key-mon which is usually included in most distributions, so you can easily install with your package manager. Then start key-mon with key-mon --visible_click. The --visible_click option is for drawing small circles around mouse clicks.

I think it dumps broken ogv file. There is some jerkiness.
When you convert it to something else with ffmpeg, it's complaining about broken frames and sometimes even segfaults

also it hasn't been updated for a decade, apparently

That looks really cool.  Note that many users don't know what CFEngine is, so you might want to mention that (then again, maybe users who don't already know what it is don't matter, haha).

Your demo GIF is pretty cool.  You might find this interesting: after recording and tidying up demo GIFs for `helm-org-ql` several times, I wrote a shell script to make it easier.  Using the `gif-screencast` package for Emacs, all I have to do is run the script, make the Emacs window active, and it does the rest.
