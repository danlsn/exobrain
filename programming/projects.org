: Peek does not support this natively. But you could install an external tool like key-mon which is usually included in most distributions, so you can easily install with your package manager. Then start key-mon with key-mon --visible_click. The --visible_click option is for drawing small circles around mouse clicks.

I think it dumps broken ogv file. There is some jerkiness.
When you convert it to something else with ffmpeg, it's complaining about broken frames and sometimes even segfaults

also it hasn't been updated for a decade, apparently

: Your demo GIF is pretty cool.  You might find this interesting: after recording and tidying up demo GIFs for `helm-org-ql` several times, I wrote a shell script to make it easier.  Using the `gif-screencast` package for Emacs, all I have to do is run the script, make the Emacs window active, and it does the rest.

: If you are the copyright holder, it's up to you how you license your work ‚ÄîI think the only catch is that you can't retrospectively revoke open-source licenses for previous versions, but I think you could easily publish an updated version with a different license, or even license with two different licenses if you wanted to. Also, if others have previously contributed to the project whilst it was under a given license, you will need their permission to relicense it, unless you have a copyright-grant agreement with them (such that they assign copyright to their contributions to you).
