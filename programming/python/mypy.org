* TODO [2019-10-26] [[https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common_issues.html?highlight=reveal_type#reveal-type][reveal_type]] can be used during the type checking
=reveal_type(a)  # N: Revealed type is 'builtins.int'=

* [2019-12-07] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8hmjq9/the_other_great_benefit_of_python_type_annotations/dyl1wjt][hack for preventing unnecessary module imports]]
Type annotation will require importing modules that you wouldn't need to import without it. However there is now a workaround (quote the name and import in a dead if):

: if False:
:     from bar_module import bar
: 
: def foo(a: 'bar'):
:      pass

* TODO [2019-10-27] how should type of lru_cache be defined
https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5107

: from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, TypeVar
: if TYPE_CHECKING:
:     F = TypeVar('F', Callable)
:     def lru_cache(f: F) -> F: pass
: else:
:     from functools import lru_cache

* TODO [2019-04-16] The Mypy Blog: Mypy 0.700 Released: Up To 4x Faster
https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2019/04/mypy-0700-released-up-to-4x-faster.html
: We are now shipping a mypy binary compiled with mypyc by default, which is up to 4x faster than the interpreted version shipped previously. The compiled version has been available as a separate PyPI distribution for a while now, and this is first release where itâ€™s installed by default. Mypyc is a compiler that compiles type-annotated Python modules into efficient CPython C extension modules.
