: In 2008, I was extremely frustrated by Ruby imposing a constant ~100 ms startup penalty on hello world. In 2018, computers are ~3.5 times faster (4479 vs. 1266 Geekbench for 2007 vs. 2017 MBP). TypeScript imposes a 1600 ms startup penalty on hello world. https://t.co/GzMcXPoFNU

: Inversion of Control principle, which basically states that the flow of your application depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution, and such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions.
: This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator.
