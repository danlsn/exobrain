:PROPERTIES:

:END:
: Inversion of Control principle, which basically states that the flow of your application depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution, and such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions.
: This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator.
