: If computers are useful post-collapse (big if), people will scavenge x86 boxes because they’re everywhere, people are far likelier to know how to use it, and they already run most everything. There’s enough around that scavenging is easier than using 1970s tech, and the older examples are quite workable with a soldering iron anyway.

- Iodine-131: one of the products of the radioactive Uranium and Plutonium decay. Half-life: 8 days.
- The thyroid gland basically stores Iodine in the human body.
- If we "overfill" our thyroid with Iodine, blocks the uptake of radioiodine. The gland won't store any more of it, including Iodine-131
- Obviously, won't save us from nuclear junk of other kinds or dirty bomb. Definitely don't save us from gamma rays.
- Potassium iodide protects from thyroid cancer.
- TODO: Cesium: half-life of 30 years.
- TODO: shower against radiation exposure?

well I mean he makes good points that software and hardware are too complicated and present an easy target for failure/civilisational collapse/whatever. but what's the alternative?

: For the past several decades the complexity of technology has continuously outpaced our ability to understand and replicate it from a first principles understanding. Not only does this leave humanity itself vulnerable to an outage of the internet or the global supply chain, it also harms our ability to understand the core technology of our civilization and violates the philosophical principle that civilization itself should have ownership of the building blocks which form it. Civboot gives humanity a place to start over -- to rethink how technology should be built from first principles as well as a place which can be improved for the benefit of all.
: 
: A Civboot is a civilizational bootstrapper, meaning it contains all essential components necessary to build and improve itself using only knowledge and tools contained within itself. In other words, it is the set of tools and knowledge necessary to design, modify and build all components that modern civilization depends on such as computers, motors, machinery, metals, electronic displays, buildings, air conditioners, energy generation, energy storage, etc. It must be able to achieve this using only raw materials, human involvement and the tools and knowledge contained within itself.

: Forth is the ideal language for bootstrapping a cobbled-together computer from whatever scraps you can find. Forth gives you a shell, an assembler, a disassembler, and a rich, extensible programming language in a few kilobytes. You can peek or poke hardware interactively, or use the REPL as a calculator. Forth-style assemblers also make cross-compilation very practical.
