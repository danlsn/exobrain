: I have few places (LANs) with ‚Äúdesktop server‚Äù in them, those servers sync everything using one syncthing instance (global discovery + relays as well).
: And then I have a mobile unit: One syncthing instance that syncs constantly only a handful of crucial folders (via LAN and Internet). Second syncthing instance that syncs all ‚Äúnon-critical + huge-sized‚Äù folders that has only local discovery on, hence will only sync when i‚Äôm on the same LAN with one of the ‚Äúdesktop servers‚Äù.
