https://forum.syncthing.net/t/can-make-syncthing-only-use-lan-connection-for-some-folders/7523/4
: I have few places (LANs) with ‚Äúdesktop server‚Äù in them, those servers sync everything using one syncthing instance (global discovery + relays as well).
: And then I have a mobile unit: One syncthing instance that syncs constantly only a handful of crucial folders (via LAN and Internet). Second syncthing instance that syncs all ‚Äúnon-critical + huge-sized‚Äù folders that has only local discovery on, hence will only sync when i‚Äôm on the same LAN with one of the ‚Äúdesktop servers‚Äù.

* [2020-04-06] (HN discussion on configs) wow, people have such strong opinions about software architecture, what it *should* be and what it *shouldn't be* etc
Like, unconditionally assuming that there is data and there is code, and that there is no middle ground whatsoever
often assuming there is one single way of doing things and that's it. incredible
