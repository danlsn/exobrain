:END:
: I've wondered about this too and I found it very hard to find good information.  It undoubtedly depends on where you live because the relative costs of water and trash removal vary so much depending where you live.  I think in water-scarce regions of Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, there is a decent argument to be made that disposable paper plates are an environmentally sensible alternative to washing lots of ceramic dinner plates. But it would very much depend on local costs and where the disposed of plates go.  Are they buried in a landfill or burned to make electricity?  How far do they have to be hauled in their lifetime?  What happens to the wastewater?


: There is no black and white in these types of situations.  Either scenario is OK and if you really want to figure out how to minimize your carbon footprint, an accurate accounting depends on your local water and electricity rates.

: The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how and why sentient organisms have qualia or phenomenal experiences‚Äîhow and why it is that some internal states are felt states, such as heat or pain, rather than unfelt states, as in a thermostat or a toaster.[1] The philosopher David Chalmers, who introduced the term "hard problem" of consciousness,[2] contrasts this with the "easy problems" of explaining the ability to discriminate, integrate information, report mental states, focus attention, and so forth.

: As one point of comparison, SymPy is comically slow compared to Sage. This is mostly because SymPy is purely Python; Sage on the other hand uses a derivative of GiNaC [1] for its internal symbolic expression representation, and then multiple external libraries for non-trivial operations. Symbolic transformations are mostly Maxima [3]. Sage literally converts expressions to strings, pipes them through a Maxima process, and then parses the result back. This is still much faster than the pure Python SymPy.
: 
: There is an effort to speed up SymPy core, SymEngine [3], but it's been in development for years now, and still isn't integrated into SymPy. Not sure why.

:END:
: When you lift weights, your muscles are using anaerobic glycolysis to convert glucose available in the muscles to ATP.
: Anaerobic glycolysis produces hydrogen ions, which inhibit the enzymes used in anaerobic glycolysis. This inhibition results in you running out of energy at the end of your set.
: These ions quickly dissipate as you rest between sets, allowing you to start your next set with almost as much strength as the first.
: Eventually though (say, after your 3rd set), you reach a point where you have depleted all the glucose stored in the muscle, and you need to allow a longer rest period to replenish the muscle glucose with glucose from the blood stream.
: This is why you suddenly reach a point where you can't do any more sets - there's no fuel left in your muscles for glycolysis.

- 
  : This is precisely why creatine "works". Creatine turns into creatine phosphate, which reacts with ADP to form more ATP. It won't make you stronger by itself, but it will allow you to train harder by providing you with "free" ATP.
- 
  : By providing extra ATP, it enables you to perform more reps and therefore tolerate more stress before you fatigue. The more stress you induce, the more your body has to adapt.
  : I think the mechanism I outlined is what the general consensus is. There are some people who dismiss creatine as "woo" and claim its sole effect is to induce water retention.
  : These people are clueless. Creatine is the single best-attested and best-validated workout supplement other than protein powder.
  : It has diminishing returns, however; furthermore, it is found naturally in food, and excessive intake leads to bloating.
  : These factors cause some people to avoid it.
