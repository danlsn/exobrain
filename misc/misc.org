: I've wondered about this too and I found it very hard to find good information.  It undoubtedly depends on where you live because the relative costs of water and trash removal vary so much depending where you live.  I think in water-scarce regions of Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, there is a decent argument to be made that disposable paper plates are an environmentally sensible alternative to washing lots of ceramic dinner plates. But it would very much depend on local costs and where the disposed of plates go.  Are they buried in a landfill or burned to make electricity?  How far do they have to be hauled in their lifetime?  What happens to the wastewater?


: There is no black and white in these types of situations.  Either scenario is OK and if you really want to figure out how to minimize your carbon footprint, an accurate accounting depends on your local water and electricity rates.

:ID:       x
:END:
: When you lift weights, your muscles are using anaerobic glycolysis to convert glucose available in the muscles to ATP.
: Anaerobic glycolysis produces hydrogen ions, which inhibit the enzymes used in anaerobic glycolysis. This inhibition results in you running out of energy at the end of your set.
: These ions quickly dissipate as you rest between sets, allowing you to start your next set with almost as much strength as the first.
: Eventually though (say, after your 3rd set), you reach a point where you have depleted all the glucose stored in the muscle, and you need to allow a longer rest period to replenish the muscle glucose with glucose from the blood stream.
: This is why you suddenly reach a point where you can't do any more sets - there's no fuel left in your muscles for glycolysis.

- 
  : This is precisely why creatine "works". Creatine turns into creatine phosphate, which reacts with ADP to form more ATP. It won't make you stronger by itself, but it will allow you to train harder by providing you with "free" ATP.
- 
  : By providing extra ATP, it enables you to perform more reps and therefore tolerate more stress before you fatigue. The more stress you induce, the more your body has to adapt.
  : I think the mechanism I outlined is what the general consensus is. There are some people who dismiss creatine as "woo" and claim its sole effect is to induce water retention.
  : These people are clueless. Creatine is the single best-attested and best-validated workout supplement other than protein powder.
  : It has diminishing returns, however; furthermore, it is found naturally in food, and excessive intake leads to bloating.
  : These factors cause some people to avoid it.

: Sikuli was started somewhen in 2009 as an open-source research project at the User Interface Design Group at MIT by Tsung-Hsiang Chang and Tom Yeh.
: Both left the project at Sikuli-X-1.0rc3 during 2012, when I decided to take over development and support and name it SikuliX.
: What is SikuliX?
: SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.

One cool thing about the journal is that it is electronic. So its searchable which is kind of cool. Its always handy to look up stuff you did in the past and when you did it, who you were with, when you went on that great vacation to the beach etc...

: Bear in mind that the scientists in the Manhattan Project thought they were developing a weapon to destroy Hitler. (As it happened the war in Europe ended a few months before the bomb was ready.)
: When you consider that von Neumann was Jewish, and had worked in Germany just before Hitler's rise to power, and certainly had many, many friends and colleagues lose their lives in the death camps--it starts to make a bit of sense. With historical figures like this, I often find it helpful to imagine being in their shoes making decisions, rather than thinking about it from our detached current-day perspective with perfect hindsight.
: Also you've probably learned that von Neumann invented the modern subject of game theory. He understood that Mutual Assured Destruction meant that, ironically, the great powers would be unlikely to ever use nuclear weapons against each other. Which has--so far--been the case. Von Neumann, if he were alive today, might point out that the number of people killed in wars has dramatically dropped since the invention of the bomb.

:END:
: During World War II, the German atomic energy program decided, by 1942, to be entirely focused on reactor development. This was, they thought, the area of nuclear fission research was most likely to produce useful military results in the short term. They thought bombs were probably possible but incredibly difficult to construct, and did not think any other nation was going to have any success with them in the short term. The German teams honestly thought they were ahead of the entire world in fission research, and when a group of the top people were carted off to a British manor house, Farm Hall, at the end of the war, they thought that maybe the Allies were trying to keep them from giving their knowledge to the Soviets (true) and that the Allies would want their knowledge for themselves (false).


: When they heard about the bombing of Hiroshima, they were shocked and surprised. Many of them refused to believe the United States could have pulled off a bomb. After getting more news information and talking it over, they realized it was in fact possible if the USA had thrown tremendous resources at it, and also realized that some of their assumptions about the size of the critical mass for the bomb were off.


: This left them in a tricky situation in terms of their egos and their nationalism. Were they simply failures? This is what Otto Hahn (discoverer of fission, and no fan of Hitler) suggested ‚Äî that they were just second-raters.


: But many of them started to create and cling to a different story. They weren't accidental failures ‚Äî maybe they were _deliberate_ failures. Maybe they didn't really _want_ to make a bomb, and that's why they didn't do it. This isn't the same thing as saying they _intentionally sabotaged_ the project, but it was more of a psychological explanation. If they had wanted to make a bomb, surely they would have done more work in that direction, right? So they must not have wanted to make a bomb. Because who would want to give Hitler a bomb?


: This story ‚Äî known to historians as the _Lesart_ of the German atomic program ‚Äî was propagated in subtle ways in the aftermath of World War II. It achieved its initial circulation in Robert Jungk's _ Brighter than a Thousand Suns_ (_Heller als tausend Sonnen_) in 1956. Jungk was the first to suggest, based on a vague _Lesart_ explanation offered up by Heisenberg, that Heisenberg had intentionally sabotaged the project. Heisenberg himself was somewhat appalled by this. Here is what he wrote to Jungk in 1956:


: > You speak here towards the end of the second paragraph about active resistance to Hitler, and I believe‚Äîpardon my frankness‚Äîthat this passage is determined by a total misunderstanding of a totalitarian dictatorship. In a dictatorship active resistance can only be practiced by people who seemingly take part in the system. When someone speaks openly against the system, he quite certainly deprives himself of any possibility of active resistance. For either he then expresses his criticism of the system only occasionally in a politically harmless form, and then his political influence can be blocked very easily; say, with respect to the youth, by people saying: Sure, old Professor X is a nice old man, but he naturally has no understanding for the enthusiasm of the youth, or something of the sort. Or, conversely, he really tries, say, to move the students politically, and then within a few days he naturally would meet his end in a concentration camp, and even his self-sacrificing death would remain practically unknown, since no one would be allowed to talk about it. _I would not want this remark to be misunderstood as saying that I myself engaged in resistance to Hitler._


: Which is rather equivocating to say the least. Heisenberg isn't actually implying he did _anything_ in this particular letter, though he is implying that he did some kind of passive resistance.


: Historians have gone over Heisenberg's wartime activities in detail. There's no evidence whatsoever of intentional sabotage. Heisenberg actually went to great lengths to show he was in line with Nazi Germany's overall foreign intentions, and used his position to stump for Germany and German culture in occupied countries. He vigorously pursued reactor research. He did not vigorously pursue bomb research, but this is because, again, he did not think it was feasible in the short term. Here is another Heisenberg letter to Jungk, from 1957:


: > [In 1941] we in the uranium project had come to the following conclusion, on the basis of our experiments with uranium and heavy water: It will definitely be possible to build an energy-producing reactor out of uranium and heavy water. In this reactor (on the basis of theoretical work by von Weizs√§cker) a product of U-239 [U-239 decays into Plutonium-239] will be generated that, like U-235, will be suitable as an explosive for atomic bombs. At the time we did not know of any process that could have produced significant quantities of U-235 with an effort that could be realized technically in Germany under wartime conditions. Since the production of atomic explosives using reactors could also obviously be realized only through many years of running huge reactors, it was clear to us in any case that the production of atomic bombs would only be possible with an enormous technical effort. Thus we knew that atomic bombs could be made in principle, but we also estimated that the necessary technical effort was
: bigger than it really was.


: > This situation seemed to us a particularly favorable precondition for the physicists to have an influence on the further course of events. For if the production of atomic bombs had been impossible, then the problem would not have arisen at all; but if it had been easily possible, then the physicists surely would not have been able to hinder their production. But the actual situation gave the physicists at this time a decisive influence on the further course of events, since they could argue vis-a-vis their governments that the atomic bombs would probably not come into
: play in the course of the war, or else argue that it would instead perhaps still be possible, with absolutely enormous efforts, to put them into play. That both ways of arguing were objectively fully justified was shown by the course of developments; for in fact even the Americans could not put the atomic bomb to use against Germany.


: The first paragraph of this letter is born out through documentation ‚Äî the Germans knew that reactors might be a route to the bomb, but they also knew it would require large reactors. Their work on a small research reactor (which would have been worthless for bomb use) was slow and piecemeal and did not reflect any active bomb concern. They knew about uranium enrichment but considered it too difficult to really pursue in earnest.


: The second paragraph is the more problematic one. Again, Heisenberg isn't actually saying that he sabotaged anything. What he's saying was, under the conditions that existed, physicists could have pushed for the bomb if they really thought they could do it, but nobody in the government would fault them if they didn't. Is he saying they didn't push for the bomb because they didn't want Hitler to have one? No. But he's allowing that interpretation to be made if you want to make it.


: In short, even Heisenberg himself didn't ever really claim that he sabotaged the German atomic bomb project in any real way. At best he implied that maybe he wasn't as enthusiastic about the bomb as he could have been, which is in line with the preservation of the idea that he wasn't just a screw-up on this front. But there's no evidence he did anything like that. Of course, as Heisenberg himself pointed out in the first letter I quoted, the nature of being a passive resister in a totalitarian government is that you appear to be going along with the plan but you might not actually be going along with it. This makes the Heisenberg issue a tricky one for historians, because, as he points out, if he simply withheld enthusiasm for the bomb but otherwise made like a good German, it would be _indistinguishable_ from the situation where he just didn't push for it because he thought it wasn't very feasible.


: I think the Farm Hall transcripts make it clear that Heisenberg truly didn't think it was feasible, and in fact hadn't thought seriously about the physics of atomic bombs at all. (His discussions there reflect deep misunderstandings about how fast neutron fission chain reactions work.) Which to me puts him in the "was just a screw-up" camp, as opposed to the "was silently and passively resisting" camp.

(Already, Wikidata gets more edits per minute than Wikipedia, albeit much of the activity is performed by bots.) It's also a successful use of Linked-Open-Data and Semantic-Web technologies (the Wikidata site hosts a SPARQL endpoint, for general queries of all sorts), so while it might not be "Old Web" per se, it feels quite retro-futuristic in many ways.

: Mostly they just suffered through. In some cases they had teeth pulled. In general, prior to modern highly starchy highly sugary diets people didn't have quite so many teeth problems, though even so any dental problems that remain without remedy tend to be extremely painful and life altering.
: There are many historical stories of people laboring through tooth and mouth pain. The oldest historical accounts of tooth problems are seven millenia old from Sumeria. Historically there was a misconception that cavities and tooth decay were caused by a "tooth worm", which is a surprisingly common belief across many different separate cultures. This might be due to the appearance of the tooth nerve, which is somewhat worm-like.
: As an example, Queen Elizabeth I of England had a history of bad teeth, and suffered from toothaches from time to time. In one case she had such a severe toothache that she couldn't sleep or get much done and eventually had the tooth extracted.
: Historical records are not really good enough to get reliable statistics on dental issues as a cause of death, though there have been studies on remains to estimate such statistics (such as [this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3094918/)) which generally come to the conclusion that poor dental health contributed to higher mortality.

: I got back a couple days ago from John Preskill‚Äòs 60th birthday symposium at Caltech.  To the general public, Preskill is probably best known for winning two bets against Stephen Hawking.  To readers of Shtetl-Optimized, he might be known for his leadership in quantum information science, his pioneering work in quantum error-correction, his beautiful lecture notes, or even his occasional comments here (though these days he has his own group blog and Twitter feed to keep him busy).  I know John as a friend, colleague, and mentor who‚Äôs done more for me than I can say.

: Believe it or not, the real answer is, 'we don't know'! The most common answer is that the jerking nature of running pulls on the ligaments tying the organs in our stomachs to our bones - but this can't be the whole answer, as people get stitches while swimming!
: Another possibility is that as the heart rate increases, the blood pressure into the liver and spleen increases, making them bigger, squeezing some blood vessels partially closed. This causes some places to not get enough oxygen.
: A third has to do with breathing. If a runner doesn't breathe deeply, part of their lungs don't get fresh air. As the blood is depleted in oxygen when it gets back to the lungs, the parts of the lungs with stale air in them aren't getting enough oxygen, and getting too much carbon dioxide, causing pain.

I plug in my phone and spend the next 2 hours drinking coffee and playing candy crush, facebook and reddit on my ipad (unless I forgot to charge that too) or my laptop. Eventually I decide to go to work. I might plug my phone into the radio using the headphone jack or I might just listen to music on radio, or NPR. Either way I drive 10 minutes to work while not thinking at all about whether I have to send an email. I'm probably thinking about boobs.

** These are lists of proverbs. Little action items, mostly dequantified, entirely decontextualized. How significant is it to ‚Äúeat wisely‚Äù and ‚Äútrim your waste‚Äù? How does it compare to other sources of harm? How does it fit into the big picture? How many people would have to participate in order for there to be appreciable impact? How do you know that these aren‚Äôt token actions to assauge guilt?

** [2019-04-19] Climate change is too important for us to operate on faith. Citizens need and deserve reading material which shows context ‚Äî how significant suggested actions are in the big picture ‚Äî and which embeds models ‚Äî formulas and algorithms which calculate that significance, for different scenarios, from primary-source data and explicit assumptions.

If data is hard to find, models are virtually impossible.
What‚Äôs a formula for estimating the power consumption of a home‚Äôs lighting?
What‚Äôs an algorithm that models the activity pattern of a water heater? Or a thermostat?
What‚Äôs an equation for how methane emissions would vary with meat consumption?
If a given country were to reduce deforestation by a given amount, how would that affect how much carbon it sinks?
How do you quantify ‚Äúeating wisely‚Äù and ‚Äútrimming your waste‚Äù? And how do you calculate the effects as those quantities change?
People have figured out these things! The formulas exist in Excel spreadsheets and Matlab code, buried on old hard drives somewhere. Sometimes they‚Äôre vaguely described in prose in published papers.
