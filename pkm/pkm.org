: I think Org transcends the idea of a wiki.  What is a wiki, anyway?  Documents with links to themselves.  Org does that and much more.
: For myself, I keep information in several Org files.


: * Information that doesn't change much, that I need to refer to now and then, that fits in a hierarchy, goes in `reference.org`.
: * Things I come across randomly that I want to record for later (e.g. web pages, snippets, quotes) goes in `cpb.org` (for commonplace book) in a datetree; I can find it later with Org search tools, including `helm-org-rifle`.
: * Appointments that are independent of other entries go in `calendar.org`.
: * Stuff I need to refile goes in `inbox.org`, but I'm trying to get in the habit of putting things in `cpb.org` instead of putting them in a massive inbox file, thinking that I'll refile them later; I never do, so I might as well put them in a datetree, which at least organizes them chronologically rather than a giant, flat list.
:   * This includes archived web pages, which I now capture with `org-web-tools-attach-url-archive`.  Sometimes I also capture the plain-text readable parts of web pages with `org-web-tools-read-url-as-org` or directly into a capture template with `org-web-tools--url-as-readable-org`.
: * Most project and task stuff goes in `main.org`.
: * Personal log/journal/diary-type entries go in `log.org`.
: * Transient stuff goes in `temp.org` (which is excluded from the git repo I keep Org files in).
: * Things I'm working on right now and want to keep in front of me (sort of like a sticky note on a monitor) go in `now.org`, which I access and manage with `org-now`.


: Hope that helps!


: Remember, Org is a platform for building your own system.  Take it easy, take your time, enjoy the ride.  Emacs and Org are software for the rest of your life.

: I have thought about these issues a lot; especially lately. With regards to being able to scrape your data or just get your data back from 3rd party's, I think that's a losing battle. You need to be in control of your data before it gets to them. Web sites and APIs are constantly changing and sometimes just disappear. This idea of polling for changes seems very brittle and would never be up to date.
: 
: What I picture is an a program that you use to store your own microblogs, blogs, contacts, comments, etc. and then you publish to whoever from that app via their API or crawling.
: 
: Imagine you just created a new microblog entry. You can now either post to your Twitter, Mastodon, etc. accounts with the click of a button. You would have to poll for replies though and it would be up to you to store them if you wished (you probably want to if you are storing your replies). As an added benefit you could see the replies in one place instead of bouncing between two sites.
: 
: The point is, when you create the data, it's yours first. Then if you want to, you can post it other places. Tools like this are abundant for businesses, but we don't seem to build tools for actual people anymore.

https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/7607/export-properties-blocks-with-org-mode

suggests looking at org-export-with-properties


ok, SPC j v org-export-with-properties

ends up at ox.el

select org-export-with-properties and SPC RET for swoop 1

swoop through, nothing

SPC s d for directory search

aha! ox-publish.el

and finally swoop to org-export--skip-p in ox.el
so apparently it sets property-drawer and calls something else with the context?
SPC s d -- aha, bunch of files including ox-html!

(property-drawer . org-html-property-drawer)

and we finally found the guilty party

(defun org-html-property-drawer (_property-drawer contents _info)

CONTENTS holds the contents of the drawer.  INFO is a plist

: For events 1, 36, 52 and 79 there seem to be only one row.
: 
: There are some inconsistencies. Both events 46 and 80 count page turns, but they don't match. The count for 80 is always less than for 46. It is possible that 46 is counting screens and 80 page numbers. The value for 46 is what is on the stats screen for the current book.
: 
: When I have looked at ExtraData, it tends to be made up of a series of timestamps. I suspect that for events like 1020 and 1021, it is a list of the times when the event occurred. The pairs from the two events might be used to calculate the minutes per session and hours read. The only problem with that, is that the counts don't match for the book I am currently reading. I am confident of the meaning of the events, but there seems to be occasions when the close is not recorded.

:  Hi everyone,
:  I wanted to share a new knowledge management tool called [Gist](https://www.gistapp.com), for exploring data visually and adding context to digital collections.
:  Full disclosure—I'm the founder. Gist is a spin-off from [Schema](https://www.schemadesign.com), a data visualization design firm based in Seattle. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the tool—whether you think it would be useful, and how you would best describe it. Since it spans so many usecases, from KM for internal teams to "memory organizations" (museums, libraries, archives) and research organizations, finding a way to describe it to all audiences has been an interesting challenge.
:  I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks!

: Nice work! However it is possible to search through annotations using emacs pdf-tools, actually the search and filter functions are quite powerful in the annotation tablist, but you need to show contents first in the tablist buffer by customizing the pdf-annot-list-format variable (more info is found in issue 553: https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/553). The annotation tablist functionality is more or less only documented in its major-mode info. The code for the search function posted in that issue works nice also (actually it works better than searching via the tablist because there is a bug in the tablist search as mentioned in the comments of that issue).
: 
: Additionally I read that you don't like to use the mouse to add annotations. With the code in the pdf-avy-highlight.el file in this repository: https://github.com/dalanicolai/dala-emacs-lisp it is possible to highlight text and add comments (if you set to open them automatically by toggling the Pdf Annot Activate Created Annotations to "on" in the pdf-annot group in the customization menu) with only the keyboard using avy. You should should add your own shortcut for it (the one in the file is for use in Spacemacs). Unfortunately it does not work more conveniently than using the mouse. But I just like to point out the possibilities and versatility of emacs and pdf-tools...

There is no reason why someone would use Supermemo instead of Anki. All that said, I use Supermemo and Anki, because I think the few free decks for languages Supermemo have are quite great and there is no way to export them so I use Supermemo with some of these decks but Anki for everything else.

: Empirically untrue, sadly. From reminiscing with friends, it's clear that both they and I have forgotten some of the best times, since I remember some of the best times and have forgotten others, and vice versa. I can remember that I had quite a bit of fun during the late eighties, but the vast majority of the detail is gone. When I've written down decade-old memories and looked at them a decade after that, it really, really often happens that I'm disturbed at how differently I remembered that event when I was halfway closer to it than now. Human memory is so sketchy and malleable that it's just barely useful at all. :(

: Hi, thanks for that detailed comment and all the resources you linked! It'll take some time to look at all of them and transfer your knowledge to this project.
: So I'm focused on developing Frontends, but I asked a friend who is very strong in building backends. We agreed that we have to try to develop a modern version org-mode with all the features we need.
: Something like [https://remotestorage.io/](https://remotestorage.io/)  what [kureshii](https://www.reddit.com/user/kureshii/) mentioned. The base idea is to build a system based on Microservices which will be specialized in certain tasks, like file formats. But all of the services will be available through one unified API. And everybody can decide how they want to consume the data, we'll provide a JS Client Side Libary. E.g. I want a dedicated Notes and ToDo app, but also something an app to organize projects where I can See notes and todo lists in relation to a project. And due to the fact that everything will be Open Source everybody can build their own Microservice, eg to add a service to make iCloud files available.
: And it'll be easy to set up because everything will be dockerized and hopefully up with only one command. And maybe in the long term we can think about a hosted version because I think that should be service everybody not only IT people should use. Yes, you lose the freedom to have everything on the server you want, but at least you have a centralized backup of all your data. And one of our focus topics will be an easy export function as markdown and if you want you could automize this to a 3rd party solution. But that's a long way to go :)
: Due to the interest, I created a new Twitter account: [https://twitter.com/The\_Minerva\_](https://twitter.com/The_Minerva_)  and already a GitHub Org [https://github.com/Minerva-Development](https://github.com/Minerva-Development) .
: I would be happy if we could stay in contact :)
: Thank you!

: PS: Yes we may reinvent the wheel, but we'll use what is already there, at least concepts and specs :)
