- Buy Rejsekort, makes it easy to travel around Denmark and you can go to Malmo with it. Mind that it needs some minimal balance (70 DKK as of writing), and bus stops often lack the top-up machine.
- If you go to Malmo, make sure to take your passport if you're not an EU citizen, there is border control on Swedish side
- Christiania is a bit overrated, just bunch of people who smoke weed
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Museum_of_Modern_Art][Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]]: a bit too small considering how far it is from the city center. However, first museum to have couple of nude art pieces I actually liked.
- [[https://bodyworlds.com/city/copenhagen][Bodyworlds]] exhibition at [[https://www.experimentarium.dk/en][Experimentarium]]: cool models and presentations of different layers of human bodies, tissue, organs etc
- [[https://disgustingfoodmuseum.com/sweden][Disgusting Food Museum]] in Malmo: pure awesomeness. Glimpse into different food cultures, lots of things to smell and touch, and even tasting bar! Also funny how my taste perception changed over the past few years: I didn't find cheese smells disgusting at all.

- Airport
  We were leaving Monday 7pm and the line for border control was ridiculous, only one out of ten booths was operational, even though the whole queue had to depart in 20 minutes. So you might really want to arrive in advance.
- Uber from airport: very cheap to city center, 8 euros.
- LisboaCard: apparently not very good value for money unless you're planning visiting museums a lot [wikitravel].
- Lisboa Viva Card get it at metro/train stations. Use it for buses, ferry, metro, suburban trains, etc.
- I've read advice to avoid the metro late at night somewhere on reddit, but can't confirm

You can get there by cheap (1.5 Eur) suburban train.

Sintra is famous for two local foodstuffs, queijadas and travesseiros. Queijadas are small sweet cakes, that are made using fresh cheese instead of butter. They are actually quite easy to make at home, but when you're there you might as well try some. Travesseiros are rectangular pastries made from fluff pastry and almond paste, and worth a try as well. [wikitravel]
***** Cabo de Rocha - very nice lighthouse, cliffs, and decent hike to the beach.

Take a bus from Sintra, but beware the way is serpentinish, in case you are prone to motion sickness. It costs something like 4 EUR, paid by cash to the driver. Also mind the schedule.

  : Enjoy a ride on a century-old tram! If the weather is warm, sit in the open trailer car. The driver takes you on a 20-minute loop tour around the city centre area (there is no commentary but photo opportunities are plenty due to there being no windows in the open tram from 1909!). The service operates annually from mid-May to the end of August, Saturdays and Sundays only, with departures from the Market Square half-hourly between 10 and 5. €5.  edit

: Secondly, Santa Marinella’s beach is convenient. Really convenient. You don’t need a car to get there, or to take a train and then a bus, like you do to get to the (admittedly prettier) beach of Sperlonga. Instead, you just hop on the train in Rome from Termini, Ostiense, Trastevere, or San Pietro; 45 minutes and €3.60 land you in Santa Marinella. From there, you can follow the crowds on the 5-minute walk to the beach.

  : Make sure you have the right equipment for a winter ascent including waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves, winter boots, ice axe & crampons, map & compass, head torch, food & drink and an emergency shelter. Goggles can be very useful on windy days. Pick a good day, but be prepared to turn back if you’re not happy with anything.
