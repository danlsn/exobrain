- AnkiDroid -- kinda ok
- duolinguo: spaced repetition for language learning
  weird, goes straight into grammar, doesn't really explain anything, synthesised voice
  liza claims it's for more advanced things
- memrise: spaced repetition for language learning
  ok, good progress, but feels too easy occasionally, weird exercise suggestions sometimes.
- using org-drill after all
