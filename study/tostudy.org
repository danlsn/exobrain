: So what are spinors for anyway? Quantities that transform like a spinor appear in quantum mechanics: the coefficients in the Dirac-equation form a spinor, for instance, because when you rewrite the equation under a change of coordinates, in order for it to remain invariant, the Dirac-coefficients must transform as spinors do.

ok, this is a very clear spinor explanation

: The only way we've figured out for handling these calculations is to do them numerically, on a lattice. (In the computer program, we discretize space and time instead of having them be continuous.) Even with this, the calculations are notoriously hard to implement, but some of them turn out good results. That animation is the result of one of those.

right, so lattice QCD will result in something fruitful presumably

we have J = int F(x, f, f'). for any variaiton v, g_e = f + e v. So, F_e = F(x, g_e, g'_e) and J_e = int F(x, g_e, g'_e)
next, total derivative: dJ_e/de = int dF_e/de dx
dF_e/de = dx/de pF_e/px + dg_e/de pF_e/pg_e + dg'_e/de pF_e/pg'_e

but dx/de = 0; dg_e/de = v and dg'_e/de = v'
in general we can't just replace pF_e/pg_e with pF/pf!!! but, we can use the fact that we are computing derivative at zero, and at zero g_e is equal to f.

so, we get dJ/de|e=0 = int v(x) dF/df + v'(x) dF/df' = 0

use integration by parts to eliminate higher order derivatives of the variation

: Two real scalar fields ϕ1ϕ1 and ϕ2ϕ2 satisfying an SO(2)SO(2) symmetry and one complex scalar field ψψ are equivalent. However, the latter is more convenient because the particles made by ψψ and ψ†ψ† are each others' antiparticles. In the real case, the fields that have this property are ϕ1±iϕ2ϕ1±iϕ2, so once you change basis from ϕ1ϕ1 and ϕ2ϕ2 to ϕ1±iϕ2ϕ1±iϕ2 you've reinvented the complex scalar field.

: Spin is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon, it cannot be understood with classical physics alone, and every analogy will break down. It has also, intrinsically, nothing to do with any kind of internal structure.
: 
: (Non-relativistic) spin arises simply because quantum things must transform in some representation of the rotation group SO(3)SO(3) in order for the operators of angular momentum to act upon them (and because we need to explain the degree of freedom observed in, e.g., the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Since the states in the QM space of states are only determined up to rays, we seek a projective representation upon the space, and this means that we actually represent the covering group SU(2)SU(2). The SU(2)SU(2) representations are labeled by a number s∈N∨s∈N+12s∈N∨s∈N+12, which we call spin. Whether the thing we are looking at is "composite" or "fundamental" has no impact on the general form of this argument.

: Spin is determined from the representation of the Lorentz group the quantum field transforms in. The projective finite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group are labeled by two half-integers (s1,s2)(s1,s2). The spin of a field is the sum s=s1+s2s=s1+s2. For example, a scalar transforms in (0,0)(0,0), a vector field in (12,12)(12,12), a Dirac spinor in (12,0)⊕(0,12)(12,0)⊕(0,12), and those have spin 00, 11 and 1212, respectively.

: For example, a photon bouncing around inside a box with mirrored internal walls is microscopically massless and propagates at c as it travels from wall to wall, but the photon’s energy contained within the box contributes to the rest mass of the stationary box. Likewise the mass of an atom is not just the sum of the microscopic rest masses of the constituent elementary particles, it also has contributions from the bound kinetic energies of those particles, as well as the binding energies.

The Higgs interaction is just one such mechanism, albeit one that operates on perhaps the most fundamental level.

: No, Quanta is fine -- you're making a subtle error, which is in fact common even in graduate textbooks.
: There are two distinct things going on here: formally "swapping" the arguments in the wavefunction, and physically moving the particles around. A priori, there is no reason the phase shifts from these two actions should be related.
: You're focusing on the swap, but it's not interesting: your argument that the swap phase squares to 1 applies to both 2D and 3D equally well. When people talk about anyons, they're talking about the phase from moving the particles. That has more options in 2D because the paths one can take when moving particles around can have a greater range of topologies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_group).


The reason that textbooks mix these things up is because in relativistic quantum field theories these two phases are always the same, by virtue of the spin-statistics theorem. But the anyons of condensed matter are nonrelativistic.

ok, interesting. basically the idea is that observer
with constant acceleration would generate an event horizon behind them
(the bigger acceleration the closer), because certain photos won't reach them ever.
Even temporary acceleration creates temporary Rindler horizons.
Then, it's similar to hawking radiation and for an accelerating observer it would create particles.

В частности, подход, основанный на расчёте ограниченных интегралов по путям, даёт следующую картину для эффекта Унру: «тепловая атмосфера» ускоренного наблюдателя состоит из виртуальных частиц, но если такая виртуальная частица поглощается ускоренным наблюдателем, то соответствующая античастица становится реальной и доступна для детектирования инерциальным наблюдателем.[4] В этом случае ускоренный наблюдатель теряет часть своей энергии. В случае эффекта Хокинга для чёрной дыры, сформировавшейся в результате гравитационного коллапса, картина другая: появляющиеся в результате эффекта частицы «тепловой атмосферы» являются реальными. Эти частицы, уходящие на бесконечность, могут наблюдаться и поглощаться удаленным наблюдателем, однако, независимо от их поглощения, эти частицы уносят массу (энергию) чёрной дыры.[4]

: From "Spacetime and Geometry, an Introduction to General Relativity" by Sean Carroll, chapter 9, pg. 412:


:     If the Rindler observer is to detect background particles, she must carry a detector--some sort of apparatus coupled to the particles being detected. But if a detector is being maintained at constant acceleration, energy is not conserved; we need to do work constantly on the detector to keep it accelerating. From the point of view of the Minkowski observer, the Rindler detector emits as well as absorbs particles; once the coupling is introduced, the possibility of emission is unavoidable. When the detector registers a particle, the inertial observer would say that it had emitted a particle and felt a radiation-reaction force in response. Ultimately, then, the energy needed to excite the Rindler detector does not come from the background energy-momentum tensor, but from the energy we put into the detector to keep it accelerating.


: So from "our" perspective as inertial observers, the accelerating observer is detecting particles due to a sort of back-emf countering whatever is accelerating her. The accelerating observer interprets this as her passing through a thermal spectrum of particles instead.

: Schrodinger's equation can be derived using symmetry arguments. Specifically, you write out the commutation relations that exist between the generators of the Galilei group and then choose the position representation. What you find is that the generator of time translations has the same form that is usually ascribed to the Hamiltonian. Details can be found, for example, in the third chapter of Ballentine's "Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development"
: Schrödingers equation can be derived by using Galilei invariance: "I encourage everyone to learn the derivation of Schrödinger's equation straight from the representation theory of the Galilei group! It's cool. (I think it appears in the books by Mackey and Jauch listed here.)" http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/symmetries.html -> Page 209 in Josef M.

something useful about parallel transport
parallell transport means that the vector is locally parallell to the curve.
geodesic is a curve whose tangent vector is parallell transported along the curve itself

if you parallell transport a pair of vectors, the angle should be preserverd, hence the covariant derivative of metric tensor must be 0

: Consider the solid ball in R3 of radius π (that is, all points of R3 of distance π or less from the origin). Given the above, for every point in this ball there is a rotation, with axis through the point and the origin, and rotation angle equal to the distance of the point from the origin. The identity rotation corresponds to the point at the center of the ball. Rotation through angles between 0 and −π correspond to the point on the same axis and distance from the origin but on the opposite side of the origin. The one remaining issue is that the two rotations through π and through −π are the same. So we identify (or "glue together") antipodal points on the surface of the ball. After this identification, we arrive at a topological space homeomorphic to the rotation group.

: Although the action S may not generally have a meaningful interpretation, there is an alternative formulation of the EL-equations which gives an equation that gives the value of S directly but not the function that achieves the minimum value of S. This equation is called the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and is also a very widely studied equation, particularly in the context of conservation laws and symplectic geometry. The standard method of solving the HJ-equation is by the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are precisely the Hamiltonian equations also learned in a typical mechanics course.

: At this point you can look in any standard text to see what happens next. The gold standard in calculus of variations is the text by Gelfand & Fomin (I strongly recommend this text, and it's also very cheap). The punchline here is twofold.
: 
: The minimum value of S is guaranteed to exist under certain conditions on L. (Most of the standard theorems require some sort of convexity condition on L.)
: 
: Under the same conditions, the minimum value of S (and which functions achieve that minimum) can be found by solving the associated Euler-Lagrange equations, which is a set of coupled, non-linear partial differential equations. (The EL-equations are found by using L.)

: This study started in the 1930s (?), and Douglas discovered necessary and sufficient conditions for a Lagrangian to exist. These conditions, which you would think should be called the Douglas conditions, are called the Helmholtz conditions. (Douglas was a mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work in the calculus of variations, specifically in the theory of minimal surfaces (think: soap films).) These conditions though are not at all easy to verify though. The conditions are of the form "Lagrangian exists if there is a non-singular matrix G such that (1), (2), and (3)". The first condition is purely algebraic, the second condition is that a certain ODE for the components of G have a solution, and the third condition is that a certain system of coupled PDE's for the components of G have a solution. The third condition is the one that is not at all easy to verify.

: I wanted to share with the community an open source python package I had been developing since November. It is called Spacetime Engine.
: [github.com/spacetimeengineer/spacetimeengine](https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/spacetimeengine)
: My name is Michael. I am a physicist who works as an engineer.  My story is that in October 2018 I was preparing to submit my first physics publication, which reviewed a particular cosmological model that I had been working with for some time. I was at the point where I had completed all of my research and was fully prepared. The only problem was that at the time I felt concerned that I may have made some mistakes which went unnoticed, so I decided to write a computer algebra software to check the veracity of my solutions so that I could feel confident in my results. After using this new utility, I realized I had made some fairly significant errors in my approach, and so the software apparently did it’s job. At first I was quite frustrated because I had put  a significant amount of time into this solution, but I realized I had a new ability to correct my own errors and expand upon what I already knew. I was now able to study any solution, and not just the ones that interested me. In fact, anyone could study any solution to the Einstein field equations if they wanted to by using this software. For this reason I realized the research I wanted to publish was not yet ready to be submitted, but the software became the real publication. I then decided to polish, package, and publish the code into a form that was accessible, informative, and educational. If you are a student new to general relativity, a gravity researcher actively working with solutions to the Einstein field equations, or an engineer who is interested in importing some of the functionality, then this package should come in handy. I was not able to publish my physics research, unfortunately, but I felt that this project served as a good alternative, and perhaps had more potential value. If you have technical questions, use the Github tools to communicate with me. You can install the package with

The example curve in the question is of the latter kind. It seems intuitive that any continuous deformation of this curve which remains closed has to still connect antipodal points, since you cannot move the ends closer to each other -- which is what you'd have to do in order to get a contractible loop -- while keeping it a closed curve.

: Right at the critical point, something very cool happens: the system transforms in a simple way under scaling! What does this mean? Well, if you get some water right at the critical point, it looks "opalescent" like a moonstone. If you stare at it carefully, you'll see a bunch of liquid water droplets of all different sizes floating around in steam. However, if you look closely at any of these droplets, you see they are full of bubbles of steam, and if you look closely at the steam, you see it's full of little droplets of liquid! It's like a random fractal: no matter how closely you look, you see the same thing. You can't tell if you're looking at water droplets in steam or bubbles of steam in water, and there is no distinguished length scale... at least until you get down to the scale of atoms, that is.

: Now, the relation between the four convenient numbers and the two important ones is quite in analogy to this case, and is therefore also a U(1) symmetry. That is how the symmetry becomes associated with electromagnetism. This tells us that if we change the four numbers by, so to say, moving them around on the circle, we do not change the two numbers describing the photon (or the six describing the electric and magnetic field). Only when we move away from the circumference, the two (and six) numbers change.

: 
:  So the Wigner's Friend experiment is basically like the Schrödinger's cat experiment, except it involves 2 people and a cat, instead of just one person and a cat. Wigner leaves the laboratory, then Wigner's friend performs the Schrödinger's cat experiment. Wigner then comes back, to find out whether or not the cat died.
: 
:  In Schrödinger's cat experiment, we say that the cat is in a super position of being both alive and dead. The question is, in Wigner's Friend experiment, do we also say that the friend is in a superposition of being happy and sad (on the assumption that the friend would be happy if the cat is alive, and sad if the cat is dead).
: 
:  Thought experiments are generally not created with the intent of "messing with people". They are often formulate to raise a point. In this case, Wigner wanted to raise the point that quantum physics, as he understood it, placed some sort of special importance on the concept of "consciousness". Wigner claims that it's not meaningful for someone to be in a superposition of being happy and sad, and so he claims that the action that "triggers" the collapse of the superposition is the friend's consciousness, and not Wigner returning to the lab to "observe" whether the friend is happy or sad.
: 
:  That said, some people believe it IS possible for a person to be in a superposition of happy and sad, and so they claim that Wigner's experiment doesn't actually show that consciousness is important after all.

: One can think of superconductivity as a breakdown of electromagnetism gauge symmetry. In other words, the "photon" acquires a mass in a superconductor. This is the description for instance given by Weinberg in his book "Quantum Field Theory" if you want to take a look. The order parameter is related to the attractive strength of electrons in the condensation of Cooper pairs.


: However that does not apply to the universe as a whole. A material piece of superconductor does break Lorentz invariance in a sense (the material occupies a finite amount of space so it is not invariant under translations).

[This paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0503400) gives a good discussion, but the basic point is that superconductivity comes about due to global U(1) symmetry breaking, and that a gauge symmetry can never *really* be broken in a physical system because it is not a physical symmetry - only a symmetry of description.

Let’s say I have a system where the potential energy function V(**r**) = U(r), where U(r) is a typical Mexican hat potential. The potential energy function has rotational symmetry, but the ground state of the system doesn’t. That’s a spontaneous symmetry breaking.


: Now imagine my potential is V(**r**) = U(r) + kx^(2).


: Now my potential has explicit dependence on x. This is an explicit breaking of rotational symmetry. The symmetry is broken in the Hamiltonian and the ground state of the system.

:  For an example of something that can be proved about groups using representation theory there's the [Burnside theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside_theorem).  For about 60 years the only known proof was using representation theory.  Nowadays we know how to prove it without representation theory but the proof is **much** more difficult.  It seems that using representation theory is the "right" or "natural" way to prove this theorem.
: 
:  In combinatorics there is a theorem concerning conjugates of regular [partitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28number_theory%29) and the Mullineux map; I have it written down in my office but I can't remember it off the top of my head.  Anyway the theorem is proven using the representation theory of S_n (group of permutations on n letters).  To date there is no known combinatorial proof.

They’re rigorous in a very curious way: It has a bunch of great physics perspectives of looking at things, and that was invaluable to me. Their view of forms as “slot machines” is also fun. In general, I found myself repeatedly consulting this book for the “true physical” meaning of a thing, such as curvature, parallel transport, the equation of a geodesic, and whatnot.

:  In the canonical picture, quantum fields are operator-valued fields (distributions, to be more precise). The Hilbert space on which they act is spanned by number states. Each number state consists of a given number of particles with given momenta and other quantum numbers (spin, color etc.). In fact the \*free\* fields behave like a set of harmonic oscillators for each momentum/spin/color/etc. Of course not every state is a number state, but they provide a basis by which you can express any state by linear combination.
:  In this picture, the fields are just operators that create and destroy particles, but the particle content is in the abstract quantum state.
:  The path integral picture is closer to the classical interpretation, but the relationship to particles is a bit more difficult to see. Basically, there is the path integral/partition functional, which consists of a sum over all possible classical field configurations weighted by the value of the action on the given field configuration. Thus all possible field configurations contribute to the amplitudes and expectation values. In the classical limit, only those configurations contribute for which the action is stationary, eg. those that satisfy the classical equations of motion.
:  TL;DR: In the canonical approach, fields are just tools. In the path integral approach, physical processes happen by summing over classical fields, even those that do not solve the (classical) equations of motion.

: And when processes like DNA transcription happen, they're not like a regular conveyor belt -- a fraction of the time the machine will even accidentally run steps in reverse!
: However, if any of this were shown, the animations would become impossible to understand.

: It's not so much "magic" as it is the sheer rate of molecular collisions in the cytosol. There are so many collisions happening that at least one of them will do what you want. Here's a back-of-the-napkin example, admittedly with many simplifications:
: A tRNA molecule at body temperature travels at roughly 10 m/s. Assuming a point-sized tRNA and stationary ribosome of radius 125 * 10^-10 m, the ray casted by the moving tRNA will collide with the ribosome when their centers are within 125 * 10^-10 m of each other. The path of the tRNA sweeps a "collidable" circle of the radius of 125 * 10^-10 m, for a cross-sectional area of 5 * 10^-16 m^2. Multiplied by the tRNA velocity, the tRNA sweeps a volume of 5 * 10^-15 m^3 per second. Constrained inside an ordinary animal cell of volume 10^-15 m^3, the tRNA would have swept the entire volume of the cell five times over in a single second. Obviously the collision path would have significant self-overlap, but at this rate it's quite likely for the two to collide at least once any given second.
: Now, consider that this analysis was only for a single ribosome/tRNA pair. A single ribosome will experience this collision rate multiplied by the total number of tRNA in the cell, on the order of thousands to millions. If a ribosome is bombarded by tens of thousands of tRNA in a single second, it's very likely one of those tRNA will (1) be charged with an amino acid, (2) be the correct tRNA for the current 3-nucleotide sequence, and (3) collide specifically with the binding site on the ribosome in the correct orientation. In actuality, a ribosome synthesizes a protein at a rate of ~10 amino acid residues per second.
: Any given molecule in the cell will experience millions to billions of collisions per second. The fact that molecules move so fast relative to their size is what allows these reactions to happen on reasonable timescales.

Basically, it uses a mathematical trick to write sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = a + b, which doesn't work for normal math, but does work if a and b anticommute: ab = -ba.

: The last term, O(ε2 ω2 |x|2 ) , may be hard to understand for beginners. It says that, actually, the plane wave isn’t plane, it gets corrections that grow quadratically with distance. These corrections, which I do not spell out in detail, come from the non-linear terms in Einstein’s equations. For trained physicists, however, it is easy to understand their physical origin: the gravitational wave carries energy, therefore has a tiny mass density, and therefore generates a gravitational field by itself. For LIGO, this is totally negligible: only if |x| becomes hundreds of millions of light years, this term becomes bothersome, but the actual gravitational source is not that far away, and/or does not shine for so many millions of years, so we never have a wave that stretches that far. To be precise: in practice you only need the linear parts of Einstein’s equations, and you have to build wave packets by superimposing these plane waves. Then, these wave packets don’t stretch that far, and the bothersome correction term never becomes large.

: of macrostate A, containing exp(SA) microstates, to macrostate B, containing exp(SB) microstates, is easily shown by the formula for the probability "summing over final outcomes, averaging over initial states", to be exp(SB−SA) higher than the probability of the inverse process (with velocities reversed). Because SB−SA is supposed to be macroscopic, such as 1026 for a kilogram of matter, the probability in the wrong direction is the exponential of minus this large difference and is zero for all practical purposes.

In this model the standard model gauge groups SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) are combined into a single simple gauge group SU(5). The unified group SU(5) is then thought to be spontaneously broken into the standard model subgroup below some very high energy scale called the grand unification scale.

: The Laplace transform takes any exponential spiral in the complex plane, and reduces to the Fourier transform if you only care about the unit circle.

:    Similarly, if you were a doctor trying to explain the meaning of a positive test result to a patient, you might say: "If we haven't seen any test results, patients like you are a thousand times as likely to be healthy as sick.

- pauli matrices are basis for the observables (!)

right, ok, even though it 'seems' that the basis state doesn't change because it 'merely' changes the phase, in some other basis you'd see basis states rotating
