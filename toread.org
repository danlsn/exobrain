This in my public todo-list, so it's constantly changing and things are moving around.

I also maintain a [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22191391-dima-gerasimov][goodreads profile]], where I rate the books.

  : The entire block is primarily presented frozen in time, on June 23, 1975, just before 8 pm, moments after the death of Bartlebooth. Nonetheless, the constraints system creates hundreds of separate stories concerning the inhabitants of the block, past and present, and the other people in their lives. The story of Bartlebooth is the principal thread, but it interlinks with many others.

: From the Preface:
: Many of the scientific treatises of today are formulated in a half-mystical language, as though to impress the reader with the uncomfortable feeling that he is in the permanent presence of a superman. The present book is conceived in a humble spirit and is written for humble people.
: From Chapter 8:
: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. -- EXODUS III, 5

- Why is it true that mathematics is so good at modeling processes in the physical sciences?
- Everything fundamental is assumed to be atomic or discrete; and thereby so is everything else.
- The principle of simplicity has driven us to reluctantly make a decision—in this paper DP is a particle model and all processes in DP are consequences of the motions and interactions of particles.
