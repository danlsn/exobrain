** TODO Books like Borges and Ted Chiang : suggestmeabook
https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/67umiu/books_like_borges_and_ted_chiang/

I greatly enjoyed Borges' work. I also like Georges Perec, especially Life: A User's Manual
Gene Wolfe: Peace is maybe his best book IMO if you are hesitant to read something as long as the Solar Cycle

*** [2019-02-27] The entire block is primarily presented frozen in time, on June 23, 1975, just before 8 pm, moments after the death of Bartlebooth. Nonetheless, the constraints system creates hundreds of separate stories concerning the inhabitants of the block, past and present, and the other people in their lives. The story of Bartlebooth is the principal thread, but it interlinks with many others.

How sci-fi should be done in 2019. You may not agree with the moral thrusts (I don't, at times), but the work is undeniably imaginative; an enchanted dream, refreshing in the age of shattered illusions. And don't miss the maze of secondary material! https://t.co/rFfrVF6Fgs

*** Why is it true that mathematics is so good at modeling processes in the physical sciences?
*** Everything fundamental is assumed to be atomic or discrete; and thereby so is everything else.
*** The principle of simplicity has driven us to reluctantly make a decision—in this paper DP is a particle model and all processes in DP are consequences of the motions and interactions of particles.
