I use it to change fonts, someone mentioned we can download YouTube videos through it.
I'm am wondering what else you guys are using it for?

Make backups of my phone and camera (external SD card) with an USB-C SD reader and usb A female, and an SATA SSD (using a SATA to USB A adapter). I use restic with a simple bash wrapper.

I make a copy every night and then I keep the disk in the hotel. If someone stoles or I lose my camera bag, I would just lose the pictures taken that day.

EDIT: *restic, not Borg. I couldn't make Borg to work.
