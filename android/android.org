:  Yes, and I wouldn't even consider buying a phone that couldn't be rooted. Main reasons include:  
:  
:  - Adaway  
:  - build.prop tweaks to change DPI and change volume steps  
:  - uninstall system apps
:  - root broswer (I use Solid Explorer)
:  - Viper4android for audio tweaks
:  - Kernel Audiutor to tweak performance
:  - WiFi key recovery to see wifi passwords you've entered
:  
:  Xposed modules including:  
:  
:  - Xposed edge for custom swipe gestures (I use swipe from the right edge to open recents)  
:  - Youtube background playback  
:  - Youtube adaway  
:  - Media volume channel
:  - Greenify  
:  - Amplify

:  Systemwide adblock, without running a VPN all the time (because I use a separate VPN for work sometimes and juggling is annoying). 
:  Blocking internet access to certain apps (Gboard, camera, etc. Don't need EVERYTHING I say keylogged by Google.)
:  Customization of stuff like emojis, where the clock is in the status bar, etc.

:  horrifying. I wake up at 6:30am with no alarm because I just do. I grab my phone to look at facebook while I take a dump. Its probably not charged and the battery is at 5% and the screen is too dim to read. So I sit it on the floor and read the back of a misc bottle on the sink. I plug in my phone and spend the next 2 hours drinking coffee and playing candy crush, facebook and reddit on my ipad (unless I forgot to charge that too) or my laptop. Eventually I decide to go to work. I might plug my phone into the radio using the headphone jack or I might just listen to music on radio, or NPR. Either way I drive 10 minutes to work while not thinking at all about whether I have to send an email. I'm probably thinking about boobs.
:  I get to work and do whatever I want, respond to a bunch of emails, ignore some others, work some on my manuscripts, teach a class. Maybe look at my phone once to see if I got a text. Go home when I feel like it. Listen to radio on way home. Put my phone down somewhere once I'm there and forget to charge it. Drink beer and watch old eps of Louis C.K. and fuck my wife (edit: or wait until she's asleep and take my phone into the bathroom to jerk it to some vid on beeg.com).
:  repeat.
