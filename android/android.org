:  - Adaway  
:  - build.prop tweaks to change DPI and change volume steps  
:  - uninstall system apps
:  - root broswer (I use Solid Explorer)
:  - Viper4android for audio tweaks
:  - Kernel Audiutor to tweak performance
:  - WiFi key recovery to see wifi passwords you've entered

:  Xposed modules including:

:  - Xposed edge for custom swipe gestures (I use swipe from the right edge to open recents)  
:  - Youtube background playback

:  Systemwide adblock, without running a VPN all the time (because I use a separate VPN for work sometimes and juggling is annoying). 
:  Blocking internet access to certain apps (Gboard, camera, etc. Don't need EVERYTHING I say keylogged by Google.)
:  Customization of stuff like emojis, where the clock is in the status bar, etc.
