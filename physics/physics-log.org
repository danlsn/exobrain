* [2018-07-31] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogradsky_instability -- explanation why differential equations of orders higher than two do not appear in physics :physics:meta:diffeq:
* [2018-08-25] In classical mechanics, the state of a system is determined by a point in phase space :lagrangian:
It's unique! In the same way as quantum state is unique

* [2018-08-23] Zee's book is a bit hard to read.. lots of jumping around and notation abuse... :physics:qft:
* TODO Why do we not have spin greater than 2? - Physics Stack Exchange :spin:

* TODO Tweet from John Carlos Baez (@johncarlosbaez), at Sep 3, 07:27 :complex:
The role of complex numbers is easy to see in the quantum description of a photon, but it's already lurking in the classical Maxwell equations.   The space of solutions of the vacuum Maxwell equations is a *complex* Hilbert space!

* TODO [2018-11-14] A soft introduction to physics for mathematicians who don't know the first thing about physics - MathOverflow :math:physics:connection:
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/51395/a-soft-introduction-to-physics-for-mathematicians-who-dont-know-the-first-thing/51411#51411
** [2019-01-10] shit, that's intense..
Another question: Why in general relativity E=mc2?
Math Answer: Because the group of Poincar√© has no cohomology

* [2019-01-07] classical mechanics - What if the Euler Lagrange equation yields a 'trivial' answer - Mathematics Stack Exchange :lagrangian:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/191935/what-if-the-euler-lagrange-equation-yields-a-trivial-answer
example lagrangian independent of path, all paths are stationary

* [2014-07-15] principles
** Locality: action in a point depends only on field or its derivatives at that point
** Lorentz invariance: action is a scalar
** Gauge invariance
