When the action, and hence the phase, is stationary changing it by a small amount doesn’t change the phase by much. In a small region (compared to ℏ) these paths can add up coherently to give a significant contribution to the sum above. This is what we see in the cartoon above for a very small subset of paths.
Classical mechanics is quantum mechanics using the stationary phase approximation.

The Lagrangian should not only be independent of the direction of v⃗ v→ but it should also change correctly under a Galilean transformation. For instance, if KK and K′K′ are two frames of reference with a relative velocity V⃗ V→ then the two Lagrangians LL and L′L′ should differ only by a total time derivative.

:   Basically, the whole thing is summarized in a nutshell in Richard P. Feynman, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Addison–Wesley, Reading, MA, 1964), Vol. II, Chap. 19. (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong here). The fundamental idea is that the action integral defines the quantum mechanical amplitude for the position of the particle, and the amplitude is stable to interference effects (-->has nonzero probability of occurrence) only at extrema or saddle points of the action integral. The particle really does explore all alternative paths probabilistically.

For most potentials, however, only sufficiently short true trajectories have minimum action; the others have an action saddle point. "Sufficiently short" means that the final space-time event occurs before the so-called kinetic focus event of the trajectory.

Furthermore, whereas in Lagrangian mechanics there is a dependence between the generalized coordinates q and their velocities (the latter being the time derivatives of the former), in Hamiltonian mechanics the momenta are to be regarded are independent from the generalized coordinates.
With these new coordinates, one proceeds to demand again that the action is minimized, and, instead of the Euler-Lagrange equations, one finds what are known as Hamilton's canonical equations. Again these are the equations of motion of the system, which are to be solved in order to find the trajectory. One key difference is that if your system required N generalized coordinates, and thus N Euler-Lagrange equations, there will be 2N Hamilton canonical equations but they are "half as difficult" to solve.

That's the best I can do without getting technical. Also, Hamiltonian mechanics is cooler, just saying.

infer ansatz for action from dimensional analysis

S_nonrel = int 1/2 m v^2(t) dt
hamilton's equation: dv/dt = 0, hence constant velocity

doesn't work for sr, rationale: is not forbidding v > c.

require action to be Lorentz scalar

S = -mc int ds -- in the nonrelativistic limit results in same physics ans nonrel lagrangian
also, that explains the fact that particle traces the path minimizing spacetime interval


momentum and hamiltonian -- coincide with energy
reparameterisation: express invariant via square root of metric and coord. derivatives


right, and we get euler-lagrange equations as a result d^2 x^u/ds^2 = 0 -- basically 4-velocity is constant!

Generalized coordinates -- like normal coordinates, but without redudancy in constraints. They are independent; basically it means that for any generalised coordinates [tuple] there must be a valid system?

benefit of generalised coordinates is most apparent when considering double pendulum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates#Double_pendulum

x'^2 + x^2 = C^2 -- energy conservation

Force F(x); potential energy U(x) as integral of force

Take 1/2 m v^2 + U(x) -- call it "total energy", it is conserved

TODO what if force depends on time explicitly?

Law of physics: there exists a three-dimenstional potential!

Principle of least action

Hamiltonian from Lagrangian

dH/dt = - \partial L / \partial t

Lagrangian -> Euler-Lagrange equations

Holonomic constraints take form: f(q_1, \dots q_n, t) = 0

Holonomic system => L = K - U

Nonholomonic system: rubber ball allowed to roll, but not slide/spin

Lagrange multipliers and forces of constraint, Taylor 278

If coordinate q_i is ignorable (dL/dq_i = 0), the corresponding generalized momentum p_i = dL/dq'_i is conserved

H(q_1 ... q_n, p_1 ... p_n)

q' = dH/dp
p' = -dH/dq

B = \nabla x A + \nabla S

A is defined up to the gradient of some scalar field, guage field

Poisson brackets

- {A, B} = - {B, A}
- {A + B, C} = {A, C} + {B, C}
- {a A, B} = a {A, B}
- {AB, C} = {A, C} B + A {B, C}


- {q_i, q_j} = 0
- {p_i, p_j} = 0
- {q_i, p_j} = delta_ij

- Q' = {Q, H} -- change of quantity over time
- {Q, L_y} -- change of quantity over rotation
