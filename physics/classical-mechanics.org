** For every symmetry, there is a conserved quantity
** Einstein was not satisfied about GR until he derived it from lagrangian (as an indication how powerful is the concept) https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3me1hr/explanation_of_lagrangian_mechanics/cveb611/
** reddit recommends Taylor's book
** as an analogy: when you learn energy, dealing with forces is much easier; when you learn lagrangian, dealing with crazy coordinates and constraints much easier
** When you find the Euler-Lagrange equations for your system, they will be written in terms of these generalized coordinates, and the terms in the equations are known as generalized forces. This is because usually the Euler-Lagrange equations have something that looks a lot like "ma" (mass times acceleration) on one side of the equations, and thus the other terms could be interpreted as "forces", but written in these general variables.

When the action, and hence the phase, is stationary changing it by a small amount doesn’t change the phase by much. In a small region (compared to ℏ) these paths can add up coherently to give a significant contribution to the sum above. This is what we see in the cartoon above for a very small subset of paths.
Classical mechanics is quantum mechanics using the stationary phase approximation.
*** hmm, interesting about Wick rotation...
Paths far from the minimum hardly contribute anything and so it isn’t necessary to calculate the action arbitrarily accurately.
eh?

The Lagrangian should not only be independent of the direction of v⃗ v→ but it should also change correctly under a Galilean transformation. For instance, if KK and K′K′ are two frames of reference with a relative velocity V⃗ V→ then the two Lagrangians LL and L′L′ should differ only by a total time derivative.

Basically, the whole thing is summarized in a nutshell in Richard P. Feynman, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Addison–Wesley, Reading, MA, 1964), Vol. II, Chap. 19. (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong here). The fundamental idea is that the action integral defines the quantum mechanical amplitude for the position of the particle, and the amplitude is stable to interference effects (-->has nonzero probability of occurrence) only at extrema or saddle points of the action integral. The particle really does explore all alternative paths probabilistically.
*** [2018-12-02] http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Principle_of_least_action#When_Action_is_a_Minimum
or some 1D potentials V(x) (those with ∂2V/∂x2≤0 everywhere), e.g. V(x)=0 , V(x)=mgx , and V(x)=−Cx2 , all true trajectories have minimum S . For most potentials, however, only sufficiently short true trajectories have minimum action; the others have an action saddle point. "Sufficiently short" means that the final space-time event occurs before the so-called kinetic focus event of the trajectory.

Принцип наименьшего действия. Часть 2 / Хабр https://habr.com/ru/post/426253/

На рисунке нарисованы обе физически возможные траектории движения шара. Зеленая траектория соответствует покоящемуся шару, в то время как синяя соответствует шару, отскочившему от пружинящей стенки.
Однако минимальным действием обладает только одна из них, а именно первая! У второй траектории действие больше. Получается, что в данной задаче имеются две физически возможных траектории и всего одна с минимальным действием. Т.е. в данном случае принцип наименьшего действия не работает.

nice pdf, basically they say it's just a different view, sometimes it's easier to control the derivative
they introduce generalised forces too
that's not surprising there is connection with thermodynamics, they show some stuff with Gibbs energy etc

** So the Fourier transform and the Legendre transform may be interpreted as the same thing, just over different semirings.

All of the dynamical laws are constructed from derivatives of H and L, and we decline to specify an additive constant for the same reason we do so with conservative potentialsi   and, more generally, anti-derivatives.

Furthermore, whereas in Lagrangian mechanics there is a dependence between the generalized coordinates q and their velocities (the latter being the time derivatives of the former), in Hamiltonian mechanics the momenta are to be regarded are independent from the generalized coordinates.
With these new coordinates, one proceeds to demand again that the action is minimized, and, instead of the Euler-Lagrange equations, one finds what are known as Hamilton's canonical equations. Again these are the equations of motion of the system, which are to be solved in order to find the trajectory. One key difference is that if your system required N generalized coordinates, and thus N Euler-Lagrange equations, there will be 2N Hamilton canonical equations but they are "half as difficult" to solve.

That's the best I can do without getting technical. Also, Hamiltonian mechanics is cooler, just saying.

** I think this is sort of misleading, they talk about dependency again...

infer ansatz for action from dimensional analysis

S_nonrel = int 1/2 m v^2(t) dt
hamilton's equation: dv/dt = 0, hence constant velocity

doesn't work for sr, rationale: is not forbidding v > c.

require action to be Lorentz scalar

S = -mc int ds -- in the nonrelativistic limit results in same physics ans nonrel lagrangian
also, that explains the fact that particle traces the path minimizing spacetime interval


momentum and hamiltonian -- coincide with energy
reparameterisation: express invariant via square root of metric and coord. derivatives


right, and we get euler-lagrange equations as a result d^2 x^u/ds^2 = 0 -- basically 4-velocity is constant!
