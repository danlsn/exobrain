[2018-11-15]  ok, so trying to consolidate everything


1. https://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/what-is-a-symplectic-manifold-really/
   TODO how to link in org mode?? e.g. citations?
here they try to deduce phase space from some reasonable mathematical assumptions (time evolution, energy conservation, flows)

1. The Geometry of Hamiltonian Mechanics


So, we have a configuration space N, which is a manifold. Typically, it's the set of positions, more generally, it's the set of all possible 'snapshots' of the system at a certain time.

(TODO how does that correspond to wavefunctions? how is position special? e.g. momentum is not any worse right?).

Then take $M = T^* N$ (cotangent bundle) -- it's the phase space, and itself a manifold.

TODO twice the dimensions? 

NOTE: ugh, looks like they are confusing p and q in [1], typically q is position/state and p is monentum. So I'm using the more common notation.

Some coordinates in M are position coordinates, some are momentum coordinates. (x_q, x_p). x_q corresponds to N, x_p corresponds to T* N at x_q? 

Ok, consider time derivative.
Time derivative of x_q is a vector   on N [1]. Note: ok, sort of makes sense.. I guess by vector they mean a point from tangent space? E.g. consider 2-sphere, time derivative is indeed a vector on that sphere.
Time derivative of x_p is a covector on N [1]. TODO: this still makes sense I guess? Not really.. I guess my confusion has to do with not understanding what's a thing from T* N?


digression:
consider 1-sphere S (radius 1). Its configurations X are angles phi from 0 to 2 pi. If you consider tangent space though, it's gonna have all possible velocities from -inf to inf. 
ok. but what about cotangent space?? | TODO what does it have to do with 1-forms
is it just the space of all {mul by v | v in (-inf, inf)}. And then what??


so time derivative of position is a vector   on N. Agree. I guess we're using the fact that N is a manifold, thus locally it's a vector space.
   time derivative of momentum is a covector on N. Well, that's a bit more subtle. I mean, it kinda makes sense, but it's a different space than T*_x N. Right?

suppose we have a functional F(t): N -> R, and we want to compute its derivative. By definition, F'(t) = (F(t+dt) - F(t)) / dt. But F(x) = <f, x>. Then, F'(t) = (<f(t + dt), x> - <f(t), x>) / dt = <(f(t + dt) - f(t))/dt, x>. So, it's dual to f', which is a time derivative of a vector, thus a covector. Ugh, ok.


Again, following [1]. Consider a function E: M -> R.
Its differential w.r.t. space coordinates is a covector, and w.r.t momentum coordinates is a vector. well, ok

dE/d(q,p) = (dE/dq1.. dE/dqn, dE/dp1...de/dpn)
Ok, I suppose you could call dE/dq a covector. why though?... what does that mean? I guess that if we plug 

TODO shit. don't think I understand that bit really intuitively...   but whatever

Ok. so we established that
    dx_q/dt and dE/dx_p are both vectors
    dx_p/dt and dE/dx_q and both covectors.
so that?? why the minus sign?

the idea is to generalise phase space mechanics to abstract (not necessarily eucledian spaces)   

we want a method to turn hamiltonian function H to a vector field V, then dynamics is the flow across integral curves of this field

requirements:
1. depend only on dH (global shift doesn't matter)
2. linear dependence on dH

he claims that tensor field, a section of Hom(T*M, TM), or Hom(TM, T*M) = (TM -> T*M) = T*M tensor T*M does that

NOTE: vector bundle -- vector space, depending on parameter (point)
NOTE: tensor field by definition is some section on tensor bundle. mmm.
NOTE: vector fields on manifold -- a section of tangent bundle. Okay, sort of makes sense. although; you could have said that it's a mapping F: (x: X) -> T(x)
NOTE: huh, so f: M -> R, df: {m: M} ->  T(M) -> R. TODO wonder if it's interesting that number of arguments is increasing?
      in general: f: M -> N, df: TM -> TN, meaning that df: {exists m: M}  (T(m) -> T(f(m)))
      TODO shit, I need agda here?...

jesus, they just don't have nice notation

tensor field is F: (x: X) -> T(x) ; T(x) is the space of all tensors at x. and that's it!


note from wikipedia: if f: M -> N, then df: TM -> TN

ok, so if H: M -> R; then dH: TM -> R = T*M
NOTE: when we think of dH, we consider it as a section, sort of with implicit {m: M} argument.


hmm, what is the tangent space of point on R. still R right? Yes, because it's basically space of 'velocities'
so dH is a covector field, ok https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B8%D1%84%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0#%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8B

so we want to turn dH: T(m) -> R into V: (m: M) -> T(m)

to do that, for every point m, we need a way to map dH_m into T(m). dH_m: (T(m) -> R) 

U* x V = Hom(U, V) = U -> V

process : (T(m) -> R) -> T(m) =

ok, use conservation of energy
that means that Hamiltonian is constant along the flow. for any H: dH(V_H) = 0, hence w(V_H, V_H) = 0. For every V, we can find its H, s.t. V_H = V, so w(V, V) = 0 for all V? so the form is alternating

TODO non-degeneracy?

 good point on first page: a more obvious set of equations is gradient flow:
dp_i/dt = -df/dp_i
dq_i/dt = -df/dq_i

it's a flow along a vector field \nabla_f, which comes from: taking -df (1-form); then using inner product on R^2n to dualise and get a vector field from 1-form.
that is:

f -> \nabla_f: <\nabla_f, x> = -df. Ok, makes sense. We can just substitute vector fields in forms to get forms of lower rank.


Hamilton's equations are similar, but instead the form is symplectic, not an inner product.

Sometimes X_H is called symplectic gradient.

Flow along the            gradient of f changes f as fast as possible
Flow along the symplectic gradient of f keeps   f constant

since dH(X_H) = -w(X_H, X_H) = 0


NOTE: I guess that's natural, we want to keep energy constant along the phase space movement.


TODO blah blah something about hamiltonian vector fields and poisson brackets


NOTE! Right, so contangent bundle is actually just an example (!) of a symplectic manifold, with some canonical structure. Another example is Kahler manifold

M = T* N
Canonical one-form theta an point (a, b) \in T*n by theta_(a,b)(v) = b(Proj_a v) 
Then the symplectic form w = d theta

TODO interesting that we throw away most of v's information. I guess that has to do with degeneracy??

hmm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautological_one-form
apparently this theta is called canonical one-form

ok, so his stuff is pretty similar.
positions q in conf space M
momentum p: in cotangent bundle T_q* M
phase space is the cotangent bundle T* M

note that velocity lies in tangent bundle T M, but momentum is defined as dL/dq', so it's in a different space

TODO so most of time, they are kind of same things... but not always. I guess I need a better sense of what momentum actually is.
I guess they are same if Lagrangian depends on v'^2/2. What would be some interesting and physical examples of Lagrangians where it's not the case?


ok, he say same thing that Hamilton's equation is analogue to gradient flow for H on the manifold T*M, but w.r.t. the symplectic form.


NOTE gradient flow is a curve, such that: x'(t) = - \Nabla F(x(t)).
Okay, kinda makes sense. Time evolution in the direction of steepest descent.

Following [2].

K   = 1/2 Sum m_a (v^a)^2
F_a = -d_a V(r)


TODO err, they define cartesian coordinates via generalised coordinates; then generalised velocities; and then rewrite K as 1/2 Sum q'^i g_ik q^k'.

shit, I don't really follow this :(

lagrangian is L: T Q -> R, so defined on tangent bundle.


Next, define the generalised momenta as p_i = dL/dq'^i. 
Ans, f_i = dL/dq^i is generalised force.

In generalised coordinates: L(q, q') = 1/2 Sum q'^i g_ij(q, m) q'^j - V(q)

Components of generalised momentum: p_i = dL/dq'^i = Sum_j g_ij q'^j. 

ok, that's sort of interesting
so, if Q is Riemannian manifold (got metric), then there is a diffeomorphism T Q -> T^* Q from tangent space to cotangent space.

metric tensor is 2-form; which means that when it acts on a vector field, we get 1-form (so momentum is 1-form)


I don't understand why they started using kinetic and potential energy staright away.


Ok, good point on page 23:

- in Lagrangian  formalism, dynamics takes place on T (T   Q)
- in Hamiltonian formalise, dynamics takes place on T (T^* Q)
- 

on page 24:

x'(t) = X_H_x(t) = J dH (x); where J is the symplectic matrix; dH is gradient of hamiltonian function. Hamiltonian vector field.


pull-backs: 

consider O: M -> T* M -- 1-form on phase space -- ok, as a member of T* M.
consider a: Q -> T* Q -- 1-form on conf  space. 

right, so a is a linear map from Q to M; and O is a 1-form on M. We can pull back O to Q to get the 1-form a* O. | err so what??

canonical poincare 1-form Theta = \Sum_i p_i dq^i, which satisfies a^* Theta = a for all a in ....

Suppose $f$ is observable. It can only depend on position, momentum and possibly time:

$f(p_i, q^i)$: $\dv{f}{t} = \sum_i \pdv{f}{q^i} \dot{q}^i + \pdv{f}{p_i} {\dot p}_i = \sum_i \pdv{f}{q^i} \pdv{H}{p_i} - \pdv{f}{p_i} \pdv{H}{q_i} := \{f, H\}$

In Cartesian coordinates, the generalized momenta are precisely the physical linear momenta. In circular polar coordinates, the generalized momentum corresponding to the angular velocity is the physical angular momentum. For an arbitrary choice of generalized coordinates, it may not be possible to obtain an intuitive interpretation of the conjugate momenta.

right, that's interesting that it's not possible to obtain intuitive sense

One thing which is not too obvious in this coordinate dependent formulation is that different generalized coordinates are really nothing more than different coordinate patches on the same symplectic manifold (see Mathematical formalism, below).

TODO should read more on that... what do they call coordinate patches?

*** TODO If the transformation equations defining the generalized coordinates are independent of t, and the Lagrangian is a sum of products of functions (in the generalized coordinates) which are homogeneous of order 0, 1 or 2, then it can be shown that H is equal to the total energy E = T + V.

: I thought about it longer and realized what was going on.
: You get equations like Hamilton's whenever a system *extremizes something subject to constraints*.   A moving particle minimizes action; a box of gas maximizes entropy.
: Read how it works:
