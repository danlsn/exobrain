TS!!  ok, so trying to consolidate everything


1. https://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/what-is-a-symplectic-manifold-really/
   TODO how to link in org mode?? e.g. citations?
here they try to deduce phase space from some reasonable mathematical assumptions (time evolution, energy conservation, flows)

1. The Geometry of Hamiltonian Mechanics


So, we have a configuration space N, which is a manifold. Typically, it's the set of positions, more generally, it's the set of all possible 'snapshots' of the system at a certain time.

(TODO how does that correspond to wavefunctions? how is position special? e.g. momentum is not any worse right?).

Then take $M = T^* N$ (cotangent bundle) -- it's the phase space, and itself a manifold.

TODO twice the dimensions? 

NOTE: ugh, looks like they are confusing p and q in [1], typically q is position/state and p is monentum. So I'm using the more common notation.

Some coordinates in M are position coordinates, some are momentum coordinates. (x_q, x_p). x_q corresponds to N, x_p corresponds to T* N at x_q? 

Ok, consider time derivative.
Time derivative of x_q is a vector   on N [1]. Note: ok, sort of makes sense.. I guess by vector they mean a point from tangent space? E.g. consider 2-sphere, time derivative is indeed a vector on that sphere.
Time derivative of x_p is a covector on N [1]. TODO: this still makes sense I guess? Not really.. I guess my confusion has to do with not understanding what's a thing from T* N?


digression:
consider 1-sphere S (radius 1). Its configurations X are angles phi from 0 to 2 pi. If you consider tangent space though, it's gonna have all possible velocities from -inf to inf. 
ok. but what about cotangent space?? | TODO what does it have to do with 1-forms
is it just the space of all {mul by v | v in (-inf, inf)}. And then what??


so time derivative of position is a vector   on N. Agree. I guess we're using the fact that N is a manifold, thus locally it's a vector space.
   time derivative of momentum is a covector on N. Well, that's a bit more subtle. I mean, it kinda makes sense, but it's a different space than T*_x N. Right?

suppose we have a functional F(t): N -> R, and we want to compute its derivative. By definition, F'(t) = (F(t+dt) - F(t)) / dt. But F(x) = <f, x>. Then, F'(t) = (<f(t + dt), x> - <f(t), x>) / dt = <(f(t + dt) - f(t))/dt, x>. So, it's dual to f', which is a time derivative of a vector, thus a covector. Ugh, ok.


Again, following [1]. Consider a function E: M -> R.
Its differential w.r.t. space coordinates is a covector, and w.r.t momentum coordinates is a vector. well, ok

dE/d(q,p) = (dE/dq1.. dE/dqn, dE/dp1...de/dpn)
Ok, I suppose you could call dE/dq a covector. why though?... what does that mean? I guess that if we plug 

TODO shit. don't think I understand that bit really intuitively...   but whatever

Ok. so we established that
    dx_q/dt and dE/dx_p are both vectors
    dx_p/dt and dE/dx_q and both covectors.
so that?? why the minus sign?

* [2018-11-10] ok, trying to break down this thing http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/symplectic.html
the idea is to generalise phase space mechanics to abstract (not necessarily eucledian spaces)   

we want a method to turn hamiltonian function H to a vector field V, then dynamics is the flow across integral curves of this field

requirements:
1. depend only on dH (global shift doesn't matter)
2. linear dependence on dH

he claims that tensor field, a section of Hom(T*M, TM), or Hom(TM, T*M) = (TM -> T*M) = T*M tensor T*M does that

NOTE: vector bundle -- vector space, depending on parameter (point)
NOTE: tensor field by definition is some section on tensor bundle. mmm.
NOTE: vector fields on manifold -- a section of tangent bundle. Okay, sort of makes sense. although; you could have said that it's a mapping F: (x: X) -> T(x)
NOTE: huh, so f: M -> R, df: {m: M} ->  T(M) -> R. TODO wonder if it's interesting that number of arguments is increasing?
      in general: f: M -> N, df: TM -> TN, meaning that df: {exists m: M}  (T(m) -> T(f(m)))
      TODO shit, I need agda here?...

jesus, they just don't have nice notation

tensor field is F: (x: X) -> T(x) ; T(x) is the space of all tensors at x. and that's it!


note from wikipedia: if f: M -> N, then df: TM -> TN

ok, so if H: M -> R; then dH: TM -> R = T*M
NOTE: when we think of dH, we consider it as a section, sort of with implicit {m: M} argument.


hmm, what is the tangent space of point on R. still R right? Yes, because it's basically space of 'velocities'
so dH is a covector field, ok https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B8%D1%84%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0#%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8B

so we want to turn dH: T(m) -> R into V: (m: M) -> T(m)

to do that, for every point m, we need a way to map dH_m into T(m). dH_m: (T(m) -> R) 

U* x V = Hom(U, V) = U -> V

process : (T(m) -> R) -> T(m) = 

** [2018-11-18]
ok, use conservation of energy
that means that Hamiltonian is constant along the flow. for any H: dH(V_H) = 0, hence w(V_H, V_H) = 0. For every V, we can find its H, s.t. V_H = V, so w(V, V) = 0 for all V? so the form is alternating

TODO non-degeneracy?


*** TODO fuck, I don't really understand the closedness thing and it might actually be crutial. maybe, later...


* START [2018-11-16]  Topics in Representation Theory: Hamiltonian Mechanics and Symplectic Geometry

 good point on first page: a more obvious set of equations is gradient flow:
dp_i/dt = -df/dp_i
dq_i/dt = -df/dq_i

it's a flow along a vector field \nabla_f, which comes from: taking -df (1-form); then using inner product on R^2n to dualise and get a vector field from 1-form.
that is:

f -> \nabla_f: <\nabla_f, x> = -df. Ok, makes sense. We can just substitute vector fields in forms to get forms of lower rank.


Hamilton's equations are similar, but instead the form is symplectic, not an inner product.

Sometimes X_H is called symplectic gradient.

Flow along the            gradient of f changes f as fast as possible
Flow along the symplectic gradient of f keeps   f constant

since dH(X_H) = -w(X_H, X_H) = 0


NOTE: I guess that's natural, we want to keep energy constant along the phase space movement.


TODO blah blah something about hamiltonian vector fields and poisson brackets


NOTE! Right, so contangent bundle is actually just an example (!) of a symplectic manifold, with some canonical structure. Another example is Kahler manifold

M = T* N
Canonical one-form theta an point (a, b) \in T*n by theta_(a,b)(v) = b(Proj_a v) 
Then the symplectic form w = d theta

TODO interesting that we throw away most of v's information. I guess that has to do with degeneracy??

hmm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautological_one-form
apparently this theta is called canonical one-form

** TODO print it!...


** TODO looks like really good paper... read more from it (or references?)

* START [2018-11-17] Terence Tao: Phase Space
ok, so his stuff is pretty similar.
positions q in conf space M
momentum p: in cotangent bundle T_q* M
phase space is the cotangent bundle T* M

note that velocity lies in tangent bundle T M, but momentum is defined as dL/dq', so it's in a different space

TODO so most of time, they are kind of same things... but not always. I guess I need a better sense of what momentum actually is.
I guess they are same if Lagrangian depends on v'^2/2. What would be some interesting and physical examples of Lagrangians where it's not the case?


ok, he say same thing that Hamilton's equation is analogue to gradient flow for H on the manifold T*M, but w.r.t. the symplectic form.


NOTE gradient flow is a curve, such that: x'(t) = - \Nabla F(x(t)).
Okay, kinda makes sense. Time evolution in the direction of steepest descent.


TODO something about definition via observables
* TODO momentum vs velocity
** https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/213991/why-specify-the-state-of-a-particle-in-terms-of-position-and-momentum-not-veloci
*** tl;dr: In classical mechanics, specifying a particle's state in terms of momentum is equivalent to specifying it in terms of velocity, but the specification in terms of momenta often has computational advantages.
*** Quantum mechanics does not have well-defined trajectories q(t), so the notion of a velocity does not make sense. On the contrary, the momentum operator can still be defined as relating to the position operator in the same way as in Hamiltonian mechanics, by replacing the classical Poisson bracket by the quantum commutator of operators.
** TODO hmm, so velocities (q') are just additional 'data' which happens to be related via q = q'(t). initially, you don't have to treat it as derivative.


* TODO that's pretty interesting https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/123725/what-kind-of-manifold-can-be-the-phase-space-of-a-hamiltonian-system
maybe visualise a hamiltonian on n-torus?

* equations of motion are dx/dt = {x, H} and dp/dt = {p, H} -- hmm, that's interesting...
https://mathoverflow.net/a/16462/29889

* https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-significance-of-a-symplectic-manifold
** I believe the significance for physics boils down to the following: it turns out that a two-form is precisely what is required to translate an energy functional on phase space (a Hamiltonian) into a flow (a vector field).

** TODO mmm...
So in some sense, "conservation of symplectic form" is the second most basic conservation law. (The most basic is conservation of energy, which is essentially the definition o


* something interesting about the fact that not all symplectic forms can be exact (if the space is not T*Q for some Q)
https://mathoverflow.net/a/16537/29889

* TODO where to put it?
Following [2].

K   = 1/2 Sum m_a (v^a)^2
F_a = -d_a V(r)


TODO err, they define cartesian coordinates via generalised coordinates; then generalised velocities; and then rewrite K as 1/2 Sum q'^i g_ik q^k'.

shit, I don't really follow this :(

lagrangian is L: T Q -> R, so defined on tangent bundle.


Next, define the generalised momenta as p_i = dL/dq'^i. 
Ans, f_i = dL/dq^i is generalised force.

In generalised coordinates: L(q, q') = 1/2 Sum q'^i g_ij(q, m) q'^j - V(q)

Components of generalised momentum: p_i = dL/dq'^i = Sum_j g_ij q'^j. 

ok, that's sort of interesting
so, if Q is Riemannian manifold (got metric), then there is a diffeomorphism T Q -> T^* Q from tangent space to cotangent space.

metric tensor is 2-form; which means that when it acts on a vector field, we get 1-form (so momentum is 1-form)


I don't understand why they started using kinetic and potential energy staright away.


Ok, good point on page 23:

- in Lagrangian  formalism, dynamics takes place on T (T   Q)
- in Hamiltonian formalise, dynamics takes place on T (T^* Q)
- 

on page 24:

x'(t) = X_H_x(t) = J dH (x); where J is the symplectic matrix; dH is gradient of hamiltonian function. Hamiltonian vector field.


pull-backs: 

consider O: M -> T* M -- 1-form on phase space -- ok, as a member of T* M.
consider a: Q -> T* Q -- 1-form on conf  space. 

right, so a is a linear map from Q to M; and O is a 1-form on M. We can pull back O to Q to get the 1-form a* O. | err so what??

canonical poincare 1-form Theta = \Sum_i p_i dq^i, which satisfies a^* Theta = a for all a in ....






* TODO some graphical intuition about covectors... http://www.physicsinsights.org/pbp_one_forms.html

* TODO [2018-11-10]  digression: [Goldberg] A Little Tase of Symplectic Geometry.pdf -- very cool!!!

* TODO something interesting about basis of tangent vectors?... https://math.stackexchange.com/a/454663/15108 v \in T_p M = v^i \delta_i?


* TODO hmm, why are alternating forms important? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_form#Alternating_multilinear_forms
so they are actually what's called covectors??

* '[Powell] Aspects of Symplectic Geometry in Physics.pdf'
Suppose $f$ is observable. It can only depend on position, momentum and possibly time:

$f(p_i, q^i)$: $\dv{f}{t} = \sum_i \pdv{f}{q^i} \dot{q}^i + \pdv{f}{p_i} {\dot p}_i = \sum_i \pdv{f}{q^i} \pdv{H}{p_i} - \pdv{f}{p_i} \pdv{H}{q_i} := \{f, H\}$

$f(p_i, q^i, t)$ -- if time dependent , then $\dv{f}{t} = \{f, H\} + \pdv{f}{t}$ -- makes sense! kinda like flow derivative from Segal

* TODO something about symplectomorphisms...
any 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold looks like R^2n, w_0 


* START [2018-11-18] ok, I should implement some simple phase space portrait plotting first
https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/gravity-sim
haskell or rust?... not sure

try L = 1/2x'^2 + x' - 1/2 x^2

TODO what if we make linear dependency on position? That's pretty much coordinate transformation right?
soo, if it's a linear dependency on velocity... it's kind of time coordinate transformation!!


* [2018-11-21]  understood A LOT while waiting for Metric concert!
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics#Deriving_Hamilton's_equations
*** mnemonic : p then q (dp/dt = dH/dq)
*** In fact, as is shown below, the Hamiltonian is the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian when holding q and t fixed and defining p as the dual variable, and thus both approaches give the same equations for the same generalized momentum. The main motivation to use Hamiltonian mechanics instead of Lagrangian mechanics comes from the symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems.
*** Hamilton's equation easily derived by looking at the total differential of Lagrangian on time
*** generalised coordinates: just any coordinates that (injectively??) map onto system configuration
*** TODO Since this calculation was done off-shell, one can associate corresponding terms from both sides of this equation to yield:
hmm, wonder if that's kinda like dimensionality argument
*** TODO 
In Cartesian coordinates, the generalized momenta are precisely the physical linear momenta. In circular polar coordinates, the generalized momentum corresponding to the angular velocity is the physical angular momentum. For an arbitrary choice of generalized coordinates, it may not be possible to obtain an intuitive interpretation of the conjugate momenta.

right, that's interesting that it's not possible to obtain intuitive sense

One thing which is not too obvious in this coordinate dependent formulation is that different generalized coordinates are really nothing more than different coordinate patches on the same symplectic manifold (see Mathematical formalism, below).

TODO should read more on that... what do they call coordinate patches?

*** TODO If the transformation equations defining the generalized coordinates are independent of t, and the Lagrangian is a sum of products of functions (in the generalized coordinates) which are homogeneous of order 0, 1 or 2, then it can be shown that H is equal to the total energy E = T + V.
not sure, that might be interesting
*** TODO The solutions to the Hamilton–Jacobi equations for this Hamiltonian are then the same as the geodesics on the manifold. In particular, the Hamiltonian flow in this case is the same thing as the geodesic flow. The existence of such solutions, and the completeness of the set of solutions, are discussed in detail in the article on geodesics. See also Geodesics as Hamiltonian flows.

*** В полярных координатах обобщённый импульс, соответствующий угловой скорости, — физический угловой момент. Для произвольного выбора обобщённых координат трудно получить интуитивную интерпретацию сопряжённых этим координатам импульсов или угадать их выражение, не используя прямо приведённую выше формулу.
sad...
*** Отсюда, в частности, следует, что если какая-то координата оказалась циклической, то есть если функция Лагранжа от неё не зависит, а зависит только от её производной по времени, то для сопряжённого ей импульса {\displaystyle {\dot {p}}=0} {\dot  {p}}=0, то есть он является интегралом движения (сохраняется во времени), что несколько проясняет смысл обобщённых импульсов.
В этой формулировке, зависящей от выбора системы координат, не слишком очевиден тот факт, что различные обобщённые координаты являются в действительности не чем иным, как различными координатизациями одного и того же симплектического многообразия.
*** Любая гладкая функция {\displaystyle H\colon M\to \mathbb {R} } H\colon M\to \mathbb{R}  на симплектическом многообразии {\displaystyle M} M может использоваться, чтобы определить гамильтонову систему. Функция {\displaystyle H} H известна как гамильтониан или энергетическая функция. Симплектическое многообразие называют фазовым пространством. Гамильтониан порождает специальное векторное поле на симплектическом многообразии, известном как симплектическое векторное поле.
*** Симплектическое векторное поле (также называется гамильтоновым векторным полем) порождает гамильтонов поток на многообразии. Интегральные кривые векторного поля являются однопараметрическим семейством преобразований многообразия с параметром, называемым время. Эволюция во времени задаётся симплектоморфизмами. Из теоремы Лиувилля следует, что каждый симплектоморфизм сохраняет форму объёма в фазовом пространстве. Множество симплектоморфизмов, порождаемых гамильтоновым потоком, обычно называют гамильтоновой механикой гамильтоновой системы.
*** Гамильтоново векторное поле также порождает специальную операцию — скобка Пуассона. Скобка Пуассона действует на функции на симплектическом многообразии, таким образом придавая пространству функций на многообразии структуру алгебры Ли.

** phase: from any point on phase space, evolution is unique. it's kinda like initial data for a differential equation


* [2018-11-20] why symplectic spaces?
  historically, we empirically noticed/observed that principle of least action works (Lagrangian formulation), and there is an alternative and completely equivalent formulation (Hamiltonian).
When we study symplectic geometry, we ask: what are the minimum requirements to *define* familiar basic physical concepts (energy/time), and so that we still have the usual properties (e.g. Hamiltonian flow).

As a bonus, we drop the requirement for configuration space, and considering its cotangent bundle -- it can be *any* symplectic space.
** TODO now figure out why is that interesting. lol
