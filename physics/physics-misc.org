: Neutron decays into proton, electron and anti-neutrino.
: 
: It is possible to decay into hydrogen atom if the anti-neutrino carries enought kinetic energy away, but the chances are really low, it was observed 4 times in one million.
: 
: 
: 
: Strong force holds *quarks* together.
: 
: The proton/neutron attraction is very strong via this force, which is why nuclei must be made of a mixture of them. Interestingly enough, the proton/proton interaction and the neutron/neutron interaction isn't nearly as strong, so nuclei made almost entirely out of just neutrons or just protons are very unstable, and will decay until they produce a regular stable nuclei.
: 
: 
: 
: But why don't electrons get stuck to the glue and end up in the nucleus too, like some sort of Plum Pudding Model? The answer is very simple: electrons don't have a nuclear charge so they are invisible to the strong nuclear force. This is a very cool part of the Standard Model of Particle Physics- there are three families of particles, the quarks, the leptons, and the gauge bosons. The quarks have this nuclear charge so they are forced to be bound into big fat nuclear particles like protons and neutrons and mesons and baryons, while the leptons, or electron family, have no nuclear charge, and so they are lighter and much more spry.

: Also, the Earth's orbital kinetic energy is larger than its binding energy due to self-gravity.
: That is, it's easier to blow up the Earth than it is to change its orbit. Something that's big enough and fast enough to change Earth's orbit significantly will also blow it apart. How much it gets blown apart depends on how big a hit it is.
: 
: 
: Light waves can slow down in a medium, but individual photons travel at the speed of light.
: 
: Also, being absorbed then re-emitted. There's a timegap where they simply don't exist as photons.
: * Not true, this is a common misconception with light in a medium. It is actually a consequence of the electric field of the material interacting with that of the incident photon wiki link.
: ** And maybe it's semantics, but I think this explanation is much better than "absorbed and re-emitted":
: As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be "shaken" back and forth at the same frequency.[13] The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a phase delay, as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them
: Describing it as "absorbed and re-emitted" makes me think way too much that some electron absorbs the energy, enters a discrete excited state for some time, and then transitions back to a lower-energy state while giving off a photon.

: The photon and gluon do not get a mass through renormalization because gauge symmetry protects them from getting a mass. This is a consequence of the Ward identity. The W-boson and the Z-boson get their masses through the Higgs mechanism; they do undergo mass renormalization through the renormalization of the electroweak theory.

: 1/T = ∂S/∂E



: The heat capacity is always proportional to N, the number of particles in the system.

: divided by the mass of the system and is independent of N.

: infinity
: right, so temp is a macroscopic property and derived from entropy, could be negative in unusual states!
: Systems with negative temperatures have the property that the number of microstates decreases as we add energy. They can be realised in laboratories, at least temporarily, by instantaneously flipping all the spins in a system.



: This also gives a quantity that you’re all familiar with — pressure, p. Well, almost. The definition is
: p = T ∂S/∂V

: Parahydrogen is in a lower energy state than is orthohydrogen. At room temperature and thermal equilibrium, thermal excitation causes hydrogen to consist of approximately 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen. When hydrogen is liquified at low temperature, there is a slow spontaneous transition to a predominantly para ratio, with the released energy having implications for storage. Essentially pure parahydrogen form can be obtained at very low temperatures, but it is not possible to obtain a sample containing more than 75% orthohydrogen by heating.

The energy decrease from the two electrons in the bonding molecular orbital is offset by the energy increase from the two electrons in the antibonding orbital.

Thus, whenever there is an equal number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals, the energy is slightly higher than it is for the isolated atoms and no bond is formed.)

To this approximation we can describe any state by giving the amplitude ⟨1|ϕ⟩ to be in the state |1⟩ and an amplitude ⟨2|ϕ⟩ to be in state |2⟩. In other words, the state vector |ϕ⟩ can be written as the linear combination
: |ϕ⟩=∑i|i⟩⟨i|ϕ⟩.

: which is −|I⟩, as required. So if we bring two hydrogen atoms near to each other with their electrons spinning in the same direction, they can go into the state |I⟩ and not state |II⟩. But notice that state |I⟩ is the upper energy state. Its curve of energy versus separation has no minimum. The two hydrogens will always repel and will not form a molecule. So we conclude that the hydrogen molecule cannot exist with parallel electron spins. And that is right.

: Though I presume the next logical question is why the weak interaction doesn't induce electron capture with hydrogen... In this case, it is because a free neutron is a higher energy, less stable system. Electron capture is only relevant in systems where the resulting neutron is stabilized by the rest of the nucleus. In cases where the neutron is *not* stabilized, you get positron emission. It is no accident that positron emission is a *common* decay mode among neutron rich nuclei.

For the strong force binding quarks into nucleons at low energies, perturbation theory has never been shown to yield results in accord with experiments,[3] thus, the validity of the "force-mediating particle" picture is questionable. Similarly, for bound states the method fails.[4] In these cases the physical interpretation must be re-examined. As an example, the calculations of atomic structure in atomic physics or of molecular structure in quantum chemistry could not easily be repeated, if at all, using the "force-mediating particle" picture

:  It all really depends on your definition of a rocky planet. Or a rock for that matter.
:  [Athleticon93](/u/Athleticon93) is right for normally formed planets. Any planet getting really big as just a rocky planet is going to accrete lots of gas too and become a gas giant. But if we want to *make* a really big rocky planet, physics won't stop us for a while
:  Start with a chunk of rock floating around in space. Let's say we borrowed mars for a bit. Don't worry, the solar system won't ask for it back. Now toss a rock down onto it. You have a bigger rocky planet. Keep doing that for a bit. The planet gets bigger and bigger. Surface gravity increases, and for now, the density of material at the core stays the same (ish). Things start to fork at this point though, depending on the thought experiment.
:  First off, just dropping the rocks is going to be a problem. Dumping planetfulls of rocks onto an ever larger planet makes heat. A *lot* of heat, which will liquefy, and eventually boil our rocks. This will also drive out any volatiles in the rock; gasses, bound water, sulfur, etc. Pretty much anything that isn't iron or nickel or another high boiling element or very stable compound. For example, limestone, a common rock, will happily decompose to CO2 and CaO. Now our ball of rocks is surrounded by an ever thickening atmosphere of gasses. Whoops, we made a gas giant.
:  So lets start again, but instead we'll teleport our rocks down to the surface. Compaction will produce some heat, but not enough to boil our rocks. *Yet...*
:  The planet could get quite big (somewhere around 3-4 times the radius of the earth), but eventually the compressive forces of gravity will be enough to start severely compressing even solid material. The density of the core will go way up. You'll notice you're adding hundreds of cubic kilometres of stuff and your planet is only growing by tens of cubic kilometers. This is going to make a lot of heat. If our rocks have a fair bit of lighter elements in them (pretty much anything higher on the periodic table than iron), eventually somewhere around 60 times the mass of Jupiter the heat and pressure will be too much and our "rocky planet" will ignite into a very weird star
:  Let's start again, again. We can't use rocks anymore, but we can use iron. Iron is at least a solid, and we can imagine running around on it pretty similarly to a regular planet. Get a big ball of iron and start the teleportation machine again with chunks of iron instead of rocks. Again, you'll see the planet grow, but after a certain point, roughly 2.5 times the radius of the earth, and several hundred times the mass, adding more mass will actually cause the radius to shrink. The iron planet will also be getting very very hot (tens of thousands of kelvin). What's happening is that the additional matter is causing increased gravity, and your planet is no longer being supported by the everyday pressure of electrostatics, like what keeps your feet from compressing a concrete floor. Instead the core is now dominated by electron degeneracy pressure. It's acting like a very hot, ultra dense gas. As you add more iron, you create more gravity. More gravity makes more pressure, more degenerate matter, and a smaller radius. Your "planet" is now a white dwarf. If you let it cool off for a few trillion years you'd be left with a ball of iron that, if you could walk around in about a hundred thousand g's of gravity, you could walk on and would be (sorta, kinda) like a planet. And that's as big as you can make a planet.

So I’ve heard it said that in the far future we could use them for interstellar GPS of sorts.

:  ~~Electronics~~ Electrons (thanks /u/StopDataAbuse) push each other away because of their negativity. This is what transfers the signal, and goes at about 50% to 99% of the speed of light depending on the material. Note that this is not related to the actual speed of the electrons themselves.
:  Now the speed of the electrons themselves is more interesting (I think). I once calculated this and I'll do it again for fun. Let's take a simple DC circuit:
:  3 volt power source, 3 ohm resistor giving 1A of current. Lets take 18 awg copper wires with a cross section surface of 0.823mm^2 according to [this](http://www.technick.net/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=guide_awg_to_metric). The length of the wires we'll define as L meter, as you'll see it doesn't matter which L we pick as long as we ignore the resistance it brings.
:  The volume of the wire is 0.823mm^2 * L meter = 0.823 10^-6 * L m^3. The density of the wire is (from Wikipedia) 8.96 g * cm^-3  = 8960 kg * m^-3. Multiply those numbers and we'll get the weight of the wire, which is 7.374 * L * 10^-3 kg. I searched for the number of free electrons every copper atom has, and a google search returns 1. So now we need the number of atoms in those wires. 7.347 * L g / (63.546 g / mol) * 6.022 * 10^23 / mol = 6.988 * 10^22 L. That's the number of free electrons in the wires. 1A is 1C / s = 6.241 * 10^18 electrons per second. That's the number of electrons that flow into the wire and out the other end every second. Divide 6.988 * 10^22 L with 6.241 * 10^18 / s and you'll get 11197 * L s. That's the number of seconds any electron stays in the wires before leaving the other end. Divide the length by this time and you'll get the speed: speed = L meters (as the length of the wires were L) / (11197Ls) = 8.93 × 10^-5 m / s. That's not very fast. It would take over 3 hours to travel through a 1 meter wire. Hope I got all the numbers right :S

right, so interaction only throught gravity is not powerful enough to make the clump of matter dense enough to form a black hole
  without other forces there's nothing to slow the dark matter particles down when they reach each other and their momentum just carries them past each other.

: really good explanation of light polarisation! I like how he adds vectors dynamically in a really nice way

TLDR: individual solutions are just simple linear oscillations, but if you add two solutions up with different phases/frequencies you can get the resulting vectors to rotate. polariser projects it into some linear subspace
there is also a wave plate, which passes through it light in different directions with different phase shifts. So you can convert linear light into circularly polarised

: Dark matter as we understand it today is, dare I say, "boring" physics. It seems to be simply another particle like the neutrino we must add to our particle zoo except that it is quite massive and there is a lot of it. Important to note that while the macroscopic evidence for dark matter is very strong, the same is not true for the microscopic description so my prior sentence could be shown to be very wrong.

:END:
: Avogadro's law holds because a perfectly ideal gas behaves exactly like a huge number of rigid macroscopic particles flying around and colliding (billiard balls, air hockey pucks, etc.). For a given temperature, pressure, and volume, the only other quantity of interest is the number of particles. Their masses do not matter because this is already taken into account in the temperature (average kinetic energy), so all systems of "ideal gasses" (or billiard balls) with the same P, V, T and particle number behave in the same way.

wow, awesome.
So, C02 is dissolved in the fizzy drink. When you shake it, you introduce air bubbles, which act as nucleation sites for the gas. When you open the bottle, they start expanding, avalanching even more nucleation sites.
You can 'disarm' the bottle by carefully removing the bubbles (e.g. tapping on the sides of the bottles)
Menthos got a rough surface, so it acts as a good nucleation site too.
Also plastic vs paper straws: paper straws also make it fizzier.

: A harmonic function is a function whose value at a point is always equal to the average of its values on a sphere centered at that point (reference). This is why they show up as steady-state solutions to the heat equation: if this averaging property weren't true, then heat would be flowing either from or to a point.

: Is it just me or it seems like Eric does not want to be understood? He seems to enjoy this title of the crazy smart guy who is so above intellectually that we cannot comprehend his thoughts. I do not buy his shtick because Richard Feynmann (who has ACTUAL contributions in physics) does a way better job in explaining  concepts. I agree with Einstein when he says "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", and since Eric talks in such a convoluted manner about his theory (even in his lecture), it seems to me that Eric's goal is NOT to present his idea.. but to plant this idea in his audience that he is right and the entire academic community is corrupt and wrong. 
: 
: I actually share that sentiment and I agree that academia has its fair share of issues (self citation, institutional bias etc).. But if you do not even upload a manuscript on the internet and expect your audience to believe your claims purely based on your vague explanation of your theory.. I just do not trust him.

: On the contrary, they are very very good conductors.
: Neutron stars are in 'beta equilibrium.' This means that there are a small number of protons and electrons. If you have too many neutrons, it is energetically favorable for some of them to beta decay and become protons and electrons. It's somewhere between a 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 ratio of neutrons to protons.
: The protons in the core are under such enormous pressure that they form Cooper pairs. This basically means that protons pair by spin, like electrons filling atomic orbitals. This produces a 'superconductor,' a conducting medium which supports enormous electric currents and magnetic fields.
