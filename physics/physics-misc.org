: Neutron decays into proton, electron and anti-neutrino.
: 
: It is possible to decay into hydrogen atom if the anti-neutrino carries enought kinetic energy away, but the chances are really low, it was observed 4 times in one million.
: 
: 
: 
: Strong force holds *quarks* together.
: 
: The proton/neutron attraction is very strong via this force, which is why nuclei must be made of a mixture of them. Interestingly enough, the proton/proton interaction and the neutron/neutron interaction isn't nearly as strong, so nuclei made almost entirely out of just neutrons or just protons are very unstable, and will decay until they produce a regular stable nuclei.
: 
: 
: 
: But why don't electrons get stuck to the glue and end up in the nucleus too, like some sort of Plum Pudding Model? The answer is very simple: electrons don't have a nuclear charge so they are invisible to the strong nuclear force. This is a very cool part of the Standard Model of Particle Physics- there are three families of particles, the quarks, the leptons, and the gauge bosons. The quarks have this nuclear charge so they are forced to be bound into big fat nuclear particles like protons and neutrons and mesons and baryons, while the leptons, or electron family, have no nuclear charge, and so they are lighter and much more spry.

: Also, the Earth's orbital kinetic energy is larger than its binding energy due to self-gravity.
: That is, it's easier to blow up the Earth than it is to change its orbit. Something that's big enough and fast enough to change Earth's orbit significantly will also blow it apart. How much it gets blown apart depends on how big a hit it is.
: 
: 
: Light waves can slow down in a medium, but individual photons travel at the speed of light.
: 
: Also, being absorbed then re-emitted. There's a timegap where they simply don't exist as photons.
: * Not true, this is a common misconception with light in a medium. It is actually a consequence of the electric field of the material interacting with that of the incident photon wiki link.
: ** And maybe it's semantics, but I think this explanation is much better than "absorbed and re-emitted":
: As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be "shaken" back and forth at the same frequency.[13] The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a phase delay, as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them
: Describing it as "absorbed and re-emitted" makes me think way too much that some electron absorbs the energy, enters a discrete excited state for some time, and then transitions back to a lower-energy state while giving off a photon.

: The photon and gluon do not get a mass through renormalization because gauge symmetry protects them from getting a mass. This is a consequence of the Ward identity. The W-boson and the Z-boson get their masses through the Higgs mechanism; they do undergo mass renormalization through the renormalization of the electroweak theory.

: 1/T = ∂S/∂E



: The heat capacity is always proportional to N, the number of particles in the system.
: It is common to define the specific heat capacity, which is simply the heat capacity
: divided by the mass of the system and is independent of N.

: it is clear that we have entered the realm of negative

: infinity
: right, so temp is a macroscopic property and derived from entropy, could be negative in unusual states!
: Systems with negative temperatures have the property that the number of microstates decreases as we add energy. They can be realised in laboratories, at least temporarily, by instantaneously flipping all the spins in a system.



: This also gives a quantity that you’re all familiar with — pressure, p. Well, almost. The definition is
: p = T ∂S/∂V

: 
: Parahydrogen is in a lower energy state than is orthohydrogen. At room temperature and thermal equilibrium, thermal excitation causes hydrogen to consist of approximately 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen. When hydrogen is liquified at low temperature, there is a slow spontaneous transition to a predominantly para ratio, with the released energy having implications for storage. Essentially pure parahydrogen form can be obtained at very low temperatures, but it is not possible to obtain a sample containing more than 75% orthohydrogen by heating.

The energy decrease from the two electrons in the bonding molecular orbital is offset by the energy increase from the two electrons in the antibonding orbital. (In fact, antibonding molecular orbitals are slightly more unfavorable than bonding orbitals are favorable. Thus, whenever there is an equal number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals, the energy is slightly higher than it is for the isolated atoms and no bond is formed.)

To this approximation we can describe any state by giving the amplitude ⟨1|ϕ⟩ to be in the state |1⟩ and an amplitude ⟨2|ϕ⟩ to be in state |2⟩. In other words, the state vector |ϕ⟩ can be written as the linear combination
: |ϕ⟩=∑i|i⟩⟨i|ϕ⟩.

: which is −|I⟩, as required. So if we bring two hydrogen atoms near to each other with their electrons spinning in the same direction, they can go into the state |I⟩ and not state |II⟩. But notice that state |I⟩ is the upper energy state. Its curve of energy versus separation has no minimum. The two hydrogens will always repel and will not form a molecule. So we conclude that the hydrogen molecule cannot exist with parallel electron spins. And that is right.

: Iron can undergo fusion. However, iron is the point where fusions starts to cost more energy than it yields, so in a typical star it doesn't fuse.
: 
: In a supernova, and the abundance of energy available in one, iron will continue to fuse to heavier materials, which is probably how we got heavier metals here on earth in the first place (it has to have fused somewhere, after all).

: This is cool as always, but in case anybody is seriously contemplating using it: this list is infamous for its complete uselessness for anybody actually trying to learn. It's mostly recommended because of 't Hooft's name, but it doesn't reflect how he actually learned physics himself, nor how anybody ever has, really.
: It's been "under construction" (i.e. completely abandoned) for two decades. Half the links are broken, and the ones that aren't tend to be whatever the top Google hit was in the 90s, not what's pedagogically best. If you're serious about learning physics, there are many much better roadmaps, like Susan Fowler's list (https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-l...).

: That is a weak interaction effect and not something mediated by the electromagnetic interaction, which was specifically what the OP was asking about. To discuss that we'd really need to move to QFT and beyond just the Schrodinger equation.
: Though I presume the next logical question is why the weak interaction doesn't induce electron capture with hydrogen... In this case, it is because a free neutron is a higher energy, less stable system. Electron capture is only relevant in systems where the resulting neutron is stabilized by the rest of the nucleus. In cases where the neutron is *not* stabilized, you get positron emission. It is no accident that positron emission is a *common* decay mode among neutron rich nuclei.

: There are limits to the validity of the virtual particle picture. The virtual-particle formulation is derived from a method known as perturbation theory which is an approximation assuming interactions are not too strong, and was intended for scattering problems, not bound states such as atoms. For the strong force binding quarks into nucleons at low energies, perturbation theory has never been shown to yield results in accord with experiments,[3] thus, the validity of the "force-mediating particle" picture is questionable. Similarly, for bound states the method fails.[4] In these cases the physical interpretation must be re-examined. As an example, the calculations of atomic structure in atomic physics or of molecular structure in quantum chemistry could not easily be repeated, if at all, using the "force-mediating particle" picture
