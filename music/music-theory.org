: Yep. The easiest way I've found is to associate intervals with songs. For example, for me, a perfect 4th is the first 2 notes to "Here Comes the Bride" and a perfect 5th is the first 2 notes of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

* TODO [#C] Huh. Tried perfect ear app and could distinguish minor and major seconds with 80% accuracy since applied reasoning about rational fractions :music:blog:

** TODO [2021-01-09] instead use toread tags? also need to exclude from Logseq's reach maybe or make togglable?

basically would be nice to 'delete' the node on ad-hoc basis to untangle the graph
also need some way to prevent tag inheritance for certain entries? e.g. via a property or something...

- techno/trance: 160-180 bpm
- backbean: beat every fourth, clap every eights
- Each type of scale has a distinct sound, and many people have particular emotional associations with particular scales.
- https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-melodies/ride.html

This is an example of minimal techno; here the focus is on slow, subtle changes, primarily to the nature of the sounds themselves, rather than to the notes and rhythms.

** [#B] harmonizing                                                   :study:

: But combining (or harmonizing) the melody with some chords helps to fill out the texture. This is an example of a simple chord progression: a series of chords played in a particular order. In many types of music, chord progressions are used to create a sense of tension and release, by moving away from the tonic of the song and then back again.
: 
:   1-5-6-4: the most common chord progression
: 
:   A pre-chorus is a section that serves as a kind of link between a songâ€™s verses and its choruses. In this song, each pre-chorus helps to build a sense of tension and energy that leads into the chorus. Each of the three eight-bar pre-choruses in this song has identical lyrics.
