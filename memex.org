#+TITLE: ‚≠ê Memex
#+filetags: memex

Memex is a system that keeps all your data and acts as an ultimate interface to it.
It gives you fast (ideally instant access), convenient interfaces and ultimately makes you better at thinking and analysing, acting as an auxiliary brain.
Arguably so far none have been built :)

I write more on why would you want it in [[https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#why][The sad state of personal data and infrastructure]].

: I think I want to create some sort of community chat on the topic of knowledge management and tools around it, with the emphasis on interoperability, malleability, owning your data, local-first, org-mode etc.

- [2020-06-18] I think I want the focus on existing tools and setup rather than discussing mockups and vague concepts. both are important, but I want to build something now
- [2020-06-18] I want it to be a space to discuss configuration, and get detailed technical help etc. So needs to be more like an IM chat, with fine grained topics (so you can steer off a discussion without spamming everyone)
*** [2021-01-04] sadly haven't had time to set up something so far, also wouldn't want to overlap with existing ones

maybe it could have some basic core (e.g. with couchdb), and then used in different apps?
e.g. promnesia uses it to jump and browse the history
dashboard uses to display all events
timeline -- similarly for all life events
