: I think I want to create some sort of community chat on the topic of knowledge management and tools around it, with the emphasis on interoperability, malleability, owning your data, local-first, org-mode etc.

- [2020-06-18] I think I want the focus on existing tools and setup rather than discussing mockups and vague concepts. both are important, but I want to build something now
- [2020-06-18] I want it to be a space to discuss configuration, and get detailed technical help etc. So needs to be more like an IM chat, with fine grained topics (so you can steer off a discussion without spamming everyone)
*** [2021-01-04] sadly haven't had time to set up something so far, also wouldn't want to overlap with existing ones

- [2020-05-27] likely needs to be [[Zulip]] (or even better, [[Matrix]] when they support threads in Element?)
- [2020-06-30] [[discord]] sucks
  - ok, discord is a bit crap because lacks proper threading
  - need to sign up to read & search it
  - you can't engage with the information (e.g. search) without joining first.
  - closed source
  - aggressive towards alternative clients

maybe it could have some basic core (e.g. with couchdb), and then used in different apps?
e.g. promnesia uses it to jump and browse the history
dashboard uses to display all events
timeline -- similarly for all life events

: Exocore is a distributed applications framework with private and encrypted data storage. Think of like an infrastructure that allows a user to own his own personal cloud that is extensible via WebAssembly applications and accessible via Web/Mobile SDKs. It is designed to be resilient to failures, allow offline usage (ex: on mobile).
