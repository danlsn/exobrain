** I've got A LOT of bookmarks. My pinboard got more than 3K -- and they are sort of curated

you want to find it eventually, with full-text search, not randomly going through the bookmarks while looking for something interesting to read
** example: deliveroo

:END:
you're browsing throught deliveroo to find something to eat. you foound few places/dishes you liked, so you wanna try them out nex time. with capture you just instantly memorise the place and potentially type a note why you did that (e.g. specific dish), without distracting
next time you going throught your bookmarks you don't need to skip over five restaurants and distract your mind
next time you want to order something you don't need to go throught all the bookmarks, you just use full text search on your knowledge repository

: Ah, gotcha. Sorry for misunderstanding! Appreciate the ideas, I just interpreted it as if you were trying to use this and were asking for features :)
: Thanks for the questions, they'll help me to update readme to make the aim and scope clearer.

would be pretty cool to extract hyperlinks from selected content and convert to org?
Would be good to have preview of what's gonna be added to server I guess. Maybe make server as dumb as possible; merely writing the formatted data?

: A feature improvement I could suggest is to open the input area in the sidebar, instead of a pop-up. The pop-up closes when one continues to read the given article. At least for me, this also interrupts the process of thought, I can't reflect on what I have noted already.
: I found the side-bar easier for writing and collecting notes, such as in this extension:
