The repository: [[https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI][karlicoss/HPI]] and [[https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html][blog post]].

This is kind of a todo-list with raw ideas and things not (yet?) worthy of github issues.

: Solid (Social Linked Data)[1] is a web decentralization project led by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, developed collaboratively at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The project "aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy"[2] by developing a platform for linked-data applications that are completely decentralized and fully under users' control rather than controlled by other entities. The ultimate goal of Solid is to allow users to have full control of their own data, including access control and storage location. To that end, Tim Berners-Lee formed a company called Inrupt to help build a commercial ecosystem to fuel Solid.

My point is showing that my private layer is actually pretty thin and you can implement something TODO suiting you by looking at mine as an example.

Same way as TODO think of some analogy? when you're using a todo list app, you've got your own unique pattern. Yet, we all benefit massively from sharing the same infrastructure

better not to use it:

- causes early inputs() calls
- propagating all the way down wrappers (dataframes/aggregate functions etc) is unrealistic anyway
- easy to override inputs() in tests, etc, sort of 'dependncy injection'

- unclear how to cachew()???

- I guess it could use nicer datatypes, e.g. dates etc. not sure if the cells are type aware though (they could 'remember' python type?)
  I guess ideally need to leverage libreoffice + publish to web??
- nice that can just use python functions
- I really don't wanna use their builtin editor... maybe best to rely on external files
- very nice that plots update automatically on data updates
- for data overlays could use a separate column

Someone comes along and proposes a unifying model (“everything is an event!”) and rebuilds the whole thing but with an extra layer of complexity. Someone suggests buying an industry data model instead - surely the data experts will have solved all these problems for us?

: This probably warrants its own post, but I strongly agree with the philosophy of Dogsheep: everything lives in a SQLite database (that you own!), each exporter tool is its own separate CLI, and Datasette is an extremely flexible tool to explore data. The Dogsheep ecosystem is totally self-hosted (you own your data) and free (as in beer), unlike personal data aggregator platforms like Exist.io and Gyroscope.

: (2) catalogs that reference the plugins you want to use alongside project specific metadata like usernames/passwords/source URIs
: (3) convenience functions that persistence, concatenation, etc

: Good writeup. A couple points.
: `zope.interface` is more explicit and scalable than `typing.Protocol`s, and more flexible than `abc.ABC`. There's a mypy plugin for it: https://github.com/Shoobx/mypy-zope
: > The drawback is that code that changes the representation of its data a lot tends not to be fast code.
: That's not a very convincing reason to avoid dataclasses except in the most performance-constrained environments -- and even then I'm doubtful it'd help. Especially with `slots=True`, dataclasses can take less resources.
** TODO [2020-09-28] this could be some sort of meta-attribute? e.g. if someone needs to override, they can monkey patch slots=False? would be nice to add to some FAQ
