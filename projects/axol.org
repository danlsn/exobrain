rss is awesome! downsides
- might be trickier to do various post-filtering
- with axol, you can compare results across queries (user summary)
- can be used with promnesia maybe
** STRT motivation: I don't understand how google search alerts work. e.g. try on openbci query (see my old emails from google alert)

multiple small:
- easier to mess with/explore
- easier concurrency
- easier to remove from reports (although for that need to make sure it's really 1-1 correspondence with source and query? dunno)
single db:
- easier to bulk clean/somewhat easier to bulk normalise
  although this would be kind of useless if I store raw json outputs
- easier to do queries across multiple (e.g. associating users?)

how it could look in adhoc mode
github:'scott alexander' twitter:'scott alexander'

in config, allow something nicer like
[twitter,github,reddit]:'scott alexander'

or [twitter,github,reddit, pinboard]:['scott alexander', 'quantified self']
pinboard:tag:scottalexander


- [ ] NOTE: echo twitter:'scott alexander' -- this is gonna get swallowed by bash... suggest to always quote?
- [ ] NOTE: treat " and ' the same? twitter does it...
