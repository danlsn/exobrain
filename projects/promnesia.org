: I think this part is a little off:
: > Perhaps you have no sympathy for web applications that store sensitive data in query strings, as that’s widely recognized as an insecure pattern. The URL fragment is more serious. That otherwise is a safe way to store sensitive information, so it’s alarming to see a third-party library sending a copy to an external server.
: > Firefox Send and Mega.nz are both examples of popular web apps that use the URL fragment to store client-side encryption keys so that users can save end-to-end encrypted files to the cloud without the server ever having access to the underlying data.
: The URL fragment is not designed to be any more secure than anything else in the URL, it's just a funny quirk of how web browsers evolved that it doesn't happen to be sent to the webserver. That popular platforms are (mis)using it to pass information without that information hitting their webservers is unfortunate. But it doesn't mean that the URL Fragment is somehow special or should be thought of as "secure" - that's not a guarantee that the URL scheme makes.
: For example, those fragments will easily appear in browser history for anyone else who uses your same device...

: The thing is that any new protocol must be introduced by clicking on the link instead of passing the address to the location bar directly. Once you connect the new protocol with the app it will work regularly.
: * Go to `about:config`
: * Add new boolean named `network.protocol-handler.expose.tg` and set it to `false`
: * Create the link by opening an empty tab and typing the following in the location bar
: `data:text/html,<a href="tg://resolve?domain=Bold">Link</a>`

ok, keeping the items in memory was definitely a bad idea..
looks like the way to go is just running a server in parallel. the benefit is being able to run against the remote server, so not having to sync the links
- the database thing -- better, but still kinda clunky to update etc
- also, we could optimize easier if it's not js, presumably some users might want to store a _lot_ of links. Also more opportunity for interaction with FS and realtime watch
- also normalisation code doesn't have to be shared with JS
