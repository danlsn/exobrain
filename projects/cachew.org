#+TITLE: Cachew
#+filetags: cachew

Cachew lets you cache function calls into an sqlite database on your disk in a matter of single decorator (similar to functools.lru_cache).
The difference from functools.lru_cache is that cached data is persisted between program runs, so next time you call your function, it will only be a matter of reading from the cache.
Cache is invalidated automatically if your function's arguments change, so you don't have to think about maintaining it.

- compact
- fast
- easy iteration
- possible to use as data interface by querying the db directly

why using separate columns at all
- actually appart from potentially nicer queries I'm not sure. I wonder if more time is spent serializing as opposed to simply using json?

** [#D] [2019-07-19] Is it possible to use a namedtuple with SQLalchemy? : Python
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz7vj/is_it_possible_to_use_a_namedtuple_with_sqlalchemy/
: sqlalchemy needs to attach attributes onto a mapped class, which include one for each column mapped, as well as an attribute _sa_instance_state for bookkeeping. It also, as someone mentioned, needs to create a weak reference to the object. So a SQLAlchemy-mapped class needs to be a "new style class", extending from object.
: If you look at how namedtuple works, it has quite a bit of trickery going on, not the least of which is that it sets __slots__ to (). Then there's some super-nasty frame mutation stuff after that to somehow make it pickleable.
: That said it's straightforward to make your own class that is SQLAlchemy compatible and acts more or less the same as a namedtuple. Just define __iter__, __len__, __repr__, other methods as appropriate. Plus it will be pickleable without injecting variables into stack frames.

- caching diffs
  - reasonable perf boost
  - relatively easy? just ignore 'emitted'?
  - automatically works for changed prefix (bleanser)
  ? requires changes to cachew key handling
  - might be still slowish

- explicitly querying for cached prefix
  - best performance
  - fairly easy
  - almost no changes to cachew
  - requires restructuting code in a specific way, mcachew thing might be harder
  - gonna be tricky if the prefix can cahnge (bleanser) (although if we can probe for a cached key, it can work?)

- single cachew decorator (not sure if possible?)
  - best performance
  - pretty simple
  - still requires 'hack' in the caller for detecting if something was cached or not
  - if prefix changes won't work
  - requires cachew changes? some sort of global function context? pretty unclear how to implement
    - with cached(f) as cf:
      return cf(some_args)
    - ok, maybe by default cachew is 'recursive'?
      when we enter the function, we memorize the argument that needs to be cached, but we don't lock the database yet?
      so, let's consider
       @cachew
       def factorials(n: int) -> int:
           last = 1
           for prev in factorials(n - 1):
      	 yield prev
           yield prev * n
      say, we've run factorials(3) before, the cache has [1, 2, 6]
      factorials(5), cachew memorizes {factorials: 5}, it's the one being computed, goes inside the function
           factorials(4) -- not in the cache. so it goes inside and tries evaluating factorials(3)
      	factorials(3) -- in the cache, cachew opens the db ans starts emitting?
      	factorials(4) shouldn't be writing becase it's not the one being computed
      	factorials(5) on the other hand should start writing
      	  kind of a problem however is that it reads and writes at the same time.. I guess that could work with transactions?

: shit. so manual operation is quite a bit faster??
: but we still want serialization :(
: ok, inserting gives noticeable lag
: thiere must be some obvious way to speed this up...

generally bugs not a big problem since the cache is temporary & optional, worst case can delete or disable
although need to make sure there are not data consistency issues... maybe expire cache on calendar?

** TODO [#B] hmm, on first initialisation in case of error it shouldn't initialise cache.. :promnesia:

right, that might happen if the object isn't supported... maybe need a nicer error message for that

Ok, so in 99% of cases it's enough to use the default directory, this will make everything much easier.
- [ ] sometimes you'd want to share a cache between computers? Make sure it works over a symlink?

It's annoying to have cache settings in every data provider and in 99% the default is fine.
So have a global HPI cache setting.

- [ ] unclear how to propagate the cache directory down to providers (e.g. reddit. ugh)

But would be nice to be able to customize the cache in advance.
Maybe, set the attribute to the function? Seems good enough?

- [X] possibly need to create the parent dir automatically?
- [ ] /var/tmp/cachew is better as the default? surfives through
- [ ] if the path is relative, to it relatively to base dir, not cwd
