: For those unaware, saving things on Reddit as a non-Premium member works in the following way:
:     limited to 1000 saved things (posts and comments) total; once the limit is reached, older things are replaced and essentially deleted from history
:     saves are stored in reverse chronological order (latest to oldest)
:     no way whatsoever to filter or sort saved content
:     no searching capability is provided
:     pagination limit on Reddit site is limited to 25 items, thus requiring users to use the “Next Page” or “Prev Page” buttons a lot

wow, the fuck?? they are deleted from history??

: I'm tackling the issue of managing Reddit saves.
: Across all platforms (not just Reddit), people including myself like to save/bookmark interesting content in the hopes of getting some use out of it later.
: The problem arises when you start accumulating too much content and forget to ever check that stuff out.

: Because our memacs-modules run automatically, it would be difficult to be notified in case of an error.
: So memacs-modules handle errors by appending them to a file:

Very nice pattern, could use it for other stuff too
