https://cedric.tech/blog/reddits-save-functionality-sucks/
: For those unaware, saving things on Reddit as a non-Premium member works in the following way:
:     limited to 1000 saved things (posts and comments) total; once the limit is reached, older things are replaced and essentially deleted from history
:     saves are stored in reverse chronological order (latest to oldest)
:     no way whatsoever to filter or sort saved content
:     no searching capability is provided
:     pagination limit on Reddit site is limited to 25 items, thus requiring users to use the “Next Page” or “Prev Page” buttons a lot

: the fuck?? they are deleted from history??

: I'm tackling the issue of managing Reddit saves.
: Across all platforms (not just Reddit), people including myself like to save/bookmark interesting content in the hopes of getting some use out of it later. The problem arises when you start accumulating too much content and forget to ever check that stuff out.
