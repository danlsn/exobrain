: R-R intervals, TP, and HF/TP were significantly decreased while LF/TP and LF/HF were significantly increased during the early recovery, when compared with control values. This could be a response to the significant decrease in SAP and DAP at this time. Twenty-four and 48 h after the end of the exercise, HRV parameters were at the same levels as before exercises in the supine posture, but a persistent tachycardia continued to be observed in the upright posture, together with reduced TP values, showing that cardiovascular functions were still disturbed. The short-term HRV recovery seemed dependent on the type of exercise, contrary to the long-term recovery.

data is inherently messy and error prone
it's sensible to be defensive and try to relax as much as possible (unless you have time to literally tend to them immediately)
on the other hand, you want to make sure you are aware about the issues in data
example: running dashboard -- has a warning about 0 speed
see screenshot at the same time (fix JS table first so duration & start_time have proper rendering)
you can instantly see it on the plot (yellow markers). if you hover, you'll see that the error is about zero speed (and you can also see it in the table)
in the table, you can clearly spot that the problem is the treadmill -- indeed, treadmill wasn't connected to the phone in any way, and I'm stationary, so endomondo has no idea how much I moved
however, I did log the distance (along with the training regime) manually
by combining the HR data (recorded by endomondo) and manual data we get the complete representation
(if I add visual highlight on the table, that would be fucking amazing)
