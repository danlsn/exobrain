bleanser stands for 'backup cleanser'.

The idea is figuring out 'redundant' backups, but in a data source agnostic way.
This is the most relevant to [[https://beepb00p.xyz/exports.html#types][incremental/synthetic]] style data exports.

This is possible for example for JSON: if the export from today is a superset of an export from yesterday, you can safely remove the old export. This actually works surprisingly well as is for many data sources.
For a few I've got slight adjustments that normalise them before comparing by removing certain fields that change often, but not very important. For example, Reddit upvotes/downvotes always jump, so I just exclude them from the comparison.
It's similar to extracting the useful fields, but instead it filters the useless ones. That makes it safer in case new fields are added by the backend, I'd rather keep extra data than potentially lose useful information.

lower bound
  specify data (fields/files etc) to preserve
if you only do that you might miss new useful data/schema changes like renames etc

. ideally they meet here
  .. warn if we ended up here, i.e. dropping is not converting with picking. but keep the data

if you only do that you end up with too much garbage
  specify data (fileds/files etc) to drop
