Bleanser' stands for 'backup cleanser'.

The idea is figuring out 'redundant' backups and removing them to

- save on disk space
- same on data access time (see [[https://beepb00p.xyz/exports.html#dal]["data access layer"]])

This is the most relevant to [[https://beepb00p.xyz/exports.html#types][incremental/synthetic]] style data exports.

It's not necessarily hard to implement for something specific, but the challenge is to do it in a data source agnostic way,
or at least with as minimum effort as possible.


This is possible for example for JSON: if the export from today is a superset of an export from yesterday, you can safely remove the old export. This actually works surprisingly well as is for many data sources.
For a few I've got slight adjustments that normalise them before comparing by removing certain fields that change often, but not very important. For example, Reddit upvotes/downvotes always jump, so I just exclude them from the comparison.
It's similar to extracting the useful fields, but instead it filters the useless ones. That makes it safer in case new fields are added by the backend, I'd rather keep extra data than potentially lose useful information.

  specify data (fields/files etc) to preserve
if you only do that you might miss new useful data/schema changes like renames etc

. ideally they meet here
  .. warn if we ended up here, i.e. dropping is not converting with picking. but keep the data
