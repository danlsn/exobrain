#+TITLE: Cannon

Cannon is a project? (algorithm? not sure) to compute canonical/normalised URLs.

At the moment it's a subproject of [[promnesia]]
https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/blob/master/src/promnesia/cannon.py

I describe the problem it tries to solve here https://beepb00p.xyz/promnesia.html#urls_broken

consider https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHrCkyoe72U&list=WL
basically
- cut of protocol just merely for simplicity? I guess makes everything much easier
- the result is always 'composed of' inputs. e.g. maps to youtube/wHrCkyoe72U, both parts are in the original link
  might not be the case if domain names are remapped though.. e.g. youtu.be
- sort query parts alphabetically
  (although might make sense to make it hierarchy aware?)
- treat parts & query the same way, parts are query with None keys
- to handle domain names better, replace dots before first / with /: e.g. www.youtube.com/ -> www/youtube/com
  then cat treat the same way as subpaths
  i.e. we get
  None www          | drop
  None youtube      | keep
  None com          | drop
  None watch        | drop
  list WL           | keep? -- actually this could be considered a 'tag'? unclear
  v    wHrCkyoe72U  | keep
ok so how do we generalize from two examples?
 e.g. say we also have
 youtube.ru/watch?v=abacaba -> youtube/abacaba
 we get
      youtube | keep
      ru      | drop
      watch   | drop
 v    abacaba | keep
I suppose it could guess that if we keep a query parameter once, we'll keep it always?
and if we extracted a certain substring without a query parameter, we'll also always keep it as is?
