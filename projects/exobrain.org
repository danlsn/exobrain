gitbook has got nice almost realtime search but only supports markdown. also they are not open source?

https://github.com/qdot/org-gitbook -- weird thing, split my headings into different pages
had to package-install ox-gfm first
- [2019-12-02] dunno, maybe starting with single page with links dump (sorted by tags then date?) and that wouldn't even require index?
  ignore priorities at first?
- [2019-12-02] one simple thing to do would be just generating html pages (with normal emacs export?) and then running JS indexer against HTML pages? could do when blog is compiled
tedious to upgrade though, but a good start?
- [2019-12-03] maybe, display everything as a single page, then it's easy to search?
