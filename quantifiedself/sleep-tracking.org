Dreem is the closest thing I've seen. It's slick but it's a bit pricier than the Zeo, $500.

Accessing the Raw Data
Beddit has a feature to download raw data to a spreadsheet, which can be very useful for doing any detailed analysis. It even gives more advanced metrics like overnight Heart Rate Variability (HRV).

Beddit also has an API to access data, but currently only available for companies or research teams.

Compared to high-end sensors on the market (Emfit QS, ResMed S+), the Beddit stands up well.

I wish ResMed would make a new one. They bought up all the intellectual property from Zeo. Instead, they put out their useless contactless tracker and sat on the Zeo tech.
I use the Zeo mobile. You can still find it and the larger units on ebay.

right, jawbone is liquidating, so guess not worth buying now
jawbone3 didn't even connect to my phone properly
nokia sleep? (igor shilov)
maybe beddit? Can't find good reviews though.
